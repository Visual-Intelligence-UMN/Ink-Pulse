analysis of key interactions in human-AI co-writing.

## Getting started

If running for the first time, ensure you have Node.js **v18 or newer** installed. You can check your version by running:

```bash
node -v
```

Install all dependencies by using: 

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the result.

## Project structure

This project is organized with the following structure(only list main folders):


### Structure

- **`/src/routes/`**  
  Contains the main application routes.

- **`/src/components/`**  
  Contains the key components used throughout the project, such as charts.

- **`/static/backend/`**  
  Contains code related to data processing. The main file for data processing is `index.py`, and additional processing logic is contained in `/static/backend/process`.

- **`/static/dataset/`**  
  Contains the processed datasets that are used by the application.

- **`/static/import_dataset/`**  
  Contains the raw data files.

- **`/static/pattern/`**  
  Contains saved patterns.

## Data Structure

We use three main data structures in this project, including raw data in the following description.

**`static/dataset/json`**: Contains each action, used for displaying points in line chart.

**`static/dataset/segment`**: Contains each segment, used for calculating the data in **`static/dataset/segment_results`**.

**`static/dataset/segment_results`**: Contains data for each segment, used for displaying bars in bar chart.

### static/dataset/json
Stores user actions on text, including content and event metadata.
  ```python
    from_json(
      "init_text": List[str],
      "init_time": List[str],
      "text": List[str],
      "info": List[Dict[str, Any]]
        [
          id: int,
          name: "suggestion-open" | "text-insert" | "text-delete",
          eventSource: str,
          event_time: str,
          event_progress: float
        ]
    )
  ```

  - **init_text**: Initial text representing the topic
  - **init_time**: Timestamp indicating when the initial text was presented
  - **text**: Full text content
  - **info**: Present each action
    - **id**: Unique identifier of the operation
    - **name**: Name of the action
    - **eventSource**: Source of the action
    - **event_time**: Timestamp of the action
    - **event_progress**: Progress of the action

Example
  ```python
  {
    "init_text": [
        "Humans once wielded formidable magical power..."
    ],
    "init_time": [
        "2021-08-17 07:22:04"
    ],
    "text": [
        "Humans once wielded formidable magical power..."
    ],
    "info": [
        {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "suggestion-open",
            "eventSource": "api",
            "event_time": "2021-08-17 07:22:12"
        },
      ...
    ]
  }
  ```
### static/dataset/segment
Stores intermediate segment-level data for computing following data. **NOT** directly used in the frontend.

  ```python
    [
      {
          "text": str,
          "source": str,
          "start_time": float,
          "end_time": float,
          "last_event_time": float,
          "start_progress": float,
          "end_progress": float
      }
  ]
  ```
  - **text**: Current context
  - **source**: Source of current context
  - **start_time**: Start time of current context
  - **end_time**: End time of current context
  - **last_event_time**: End time of the session
  - **start_progress**: Start progress of current context
  - **end_progress**: End progress of current context

Example
  ```python
    [
      {
          "text": "Humans once wielded formidable magical power. But with over 7 billion of us on the planet now, Mana has spread far too thinly to have any effect. When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again.\n",
          "source": "api",
          "start_time": 0.0,
          "end_time": 0.0,
          "last_event_time": 0.0,
          "start_progress": 0,
          "end_progress": 0.09318259677971909
      },
      {
          "text": "Humans once wielded formidable magical power. But with over 7 billion of us on the planet now, Mana has spread far too thinly to have any effect. When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again.\n\nThe world is a dangerous place, but it is also filled with wonder.\n",
          "source": "api",
          "start_time": 8.0,
          "end_time": 13.0,
          "last_event_time": 13.0,

      "textDelta": {
          "ops": list[{
              "retain": int,
              "insert": str
          }]
      }
    }
  ```

  ```python
  {"eventName": "text-insert", "eventSource": "api", "eventTimestamp": 1629952145999, "textDelta": {"ops": [{"retain": 2793}, {"insert": "We need to be able to..."}]}, ...}

  ```

## How to import your own dataset

Before loading your dataset, please check the data structure above.

Put your dataset in folder **`static/import_dataset`**

Your dataset should contains:

1. data/session.jsonl

2. data.csv

session.jsonl format should be similar as the raw data above.

dataset.csv should contain at least **session_id** and **prompt_code**. Sample can be checked in **`static/import_dataset/creative.csv`**.

If you want to change the method for calculating **semantic score** or **writing quality score**, related code can be found in **`static/backend/process`**, in `openai_residual_vector.py` and `evaluator.py`.
