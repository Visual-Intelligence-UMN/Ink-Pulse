Upon closer inspection, the investigators could not find anything that could explain why all the citizens of the country of Larkinson had vanished. No evidence of natural disasters, no destruction of their buildings, and no records of what happened during the seven years of isolation were found. The investigators could not find any clues as to what happened to the country, and they disclosed their findings to the UN, ultimately confirming that the country of Larkinson was no more. The nations of the world mourned the loss of the country, and ultimately set up a day to acknowledge the travesty that befell it.\n\nThat isn't to say that the mourning lasted forever, as the other countries of the world begin to excavate and acquire the resources of Larkinson, having made an agreement to share the Larkinsonite they would find among each other. Sure enough, the Larkinsonite was excavated from the ground, and the countries of the world began to use it to their advantage. Through time, scientists had been able to replicate the innovative material, which allowed technology to prosper even further as the nations of the world now had access to the material from the confines of its own borders. Larkinson was soon then no longer a point of interest for the world, especially so as its supply of Larkinson dwindled. In time the countries of the world began to forget the once great nation and its contribution to the world. Its isolation had been the means for its destruction, but it was also the means for the prosperity of the world. In a sense, Larkinson still exists today all around the world, as Larkinsonite is still a critical part of the electronics of every household that exist in the year 3103. Although people would eventually forget that the country of Larkinson ever existed, the country would truly never be forgotten for how it revolutionized society and impacted its technological growth in the coming years.\n",
