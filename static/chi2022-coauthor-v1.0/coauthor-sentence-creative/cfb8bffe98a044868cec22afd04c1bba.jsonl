He came into the relationship expecting that it will work out , as he should. It started out really good but then thing started to go haywire after the 5th month  She stared to get very moody and was mad at him for no reason when he would ask her simple questions like what are they gonna do this weekend . One day he asked her what she wanted for dinner as she was not going to cook that day and she just went off on him and called him all kinds of names that you would not imagine. He thought he had enough of it but he decided to give her a chance once more as he wanted to be the one. As things went on it was just an up and down roller coaster for him. He tried to put up with it day in and day out but some days were just harder than others. \n",

He told her this is not what he signed up for and that he will go his way unless she gets some kind of mental help. She agreed sort of but was not 100% on board. They argued the entire holiday season but eventually on Jan 5th she decided to go and get the help she so much needed. \n",
