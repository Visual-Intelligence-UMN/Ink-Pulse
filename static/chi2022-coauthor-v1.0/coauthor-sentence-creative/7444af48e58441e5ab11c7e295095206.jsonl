The human race is going to make it extremely difficult for Rayne to actually cash out on her payday since they are going to make it near impossible to actually get the bounty owed to her for kidnapping him.

Rayne is totally shocked to see Barth standing in her way of cashing out on the kidnapping. How dare this mere mortal human try to thwart her plans for cash? Barth tells the alien to let go of Matt Damon, or things could get really ugly. The alien thinks that she is in charge, but Barth insists that he's the one in charge.
