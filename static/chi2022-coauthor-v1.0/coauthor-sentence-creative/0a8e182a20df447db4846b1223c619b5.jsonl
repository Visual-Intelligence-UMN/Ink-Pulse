To these few people, this is all too much like a scene from Avengers, and the aliens are no more than a Thanos that needs to be reckoned with.\n\nWhen the time is ready to do battle, it will be silently fought and the invaders won't know what is coming. Mana is magic that isn't showy or ostentatious. It is subtle and the Keepers and their students will strike without warning. The power comes from being of one mind and fighting for one cause. Mana gathers it's strength from everyone collectively reaching towards the same goal, which is getting rid of the aliens. When the Earth was over populated, Mana struggled to survive because humans were always at odds with each other. Political battles, gender battles, income battles. All of the hatred humans had for one another, kept Mana silent and not of much use. Now that humans collectively are fighting to rid their world of the aliens, the power they hold is insurmountable. They will win this war. \n\nThe day finally arrives when everyone on Earth has been taught the basic principals of the old magic. When all people are ready to be better and do better with the new world they are about to obtain. They collectively think of what they hope to achieve and how they hope to be when the aliens are gone. Then Mana takes over, and their lives being anew.  And wonderful.  Everything they had wished for in their old lives becomes a reality.\n",
