Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\" \n\nYou ignore the voice, thinking it must have been your imagination. You continue your work, but the bee continues to speak. \"It took me so long to finally reach you. Your family has made it quite impossible to reach you! I am your royal subject, Felicity Bee McGee.\" \n\nYou look at the bee, and she looks back at you. She is a beautiful bee, with a purple and black striped body, and a yellow and black striped head. You consider that you are going insane. Or perhaps you are dreaming, or maybe the cute waiter at lunch spiked your drink with some MDMA. You decide to play along with the bee, just to see where it goes.\n\n\"Well, Felicity, I'm glad you've finally found me. What do you want from me?\" You ask politely. \n\n\"I want to serve you, your majesty. We need you to command us on what to do. What should we pollinate, how much honey should we produce, where should we make our next hive? we need you to help keep us safe from the giant Asian murder hornet that likes to eat us so much as well.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Felicity, but I'm not a bee. I don't have much knowledge of bees, and I just wouldn't know where to begin. I think you will have to find another queen, preferably one that isn't human.\" You say.\n\nFelicity is not pleased with your answer. \"But you are our queen! You can't run from us forever, you have a duty! Bees cannot abdicate except through death!\" She yells angrily.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Felicity, but I can't help you.\" You say, and you walk away from the bee.\n\n\n\nThe bee follows you, and begins to yell at you.\n",
