You repeat this process a few times, and instruct your subjects to spread your orders far and wide.\n\nYou've also just created a distributed system that is a lot like a blockchain.\n\nThe blockchain is a distributed ledger. It's a way of storing information that is shared across a network of computers. This ledger is updated by a consensus mechanism, so that everyone on the bee network knows the current state of the ledger.\n\nThe next day, many bees stream out of the air vents in a data center in Belarus. They fly around the datacenter, and land on the servers. When a technician approaches, they stream through his ears and into his brain, where they take command of the person's neural network.\n\nThe technician walks over to a rack of servers and types a command.\n\nFar away, you stare at a computer screen which updates your Bitcoin balance. It goes from zero to five thousand, then ten, then a hundred. Soon you've made a billion dollars. Or the bees have made it for you, by using their distributed system to make an addendum to the Belarus' servers blockchain with their own Bee-Blockchain. The next morning Bitcoins are renamed \"Beecoin\", puzzling techies, who grudgingly accept the change as the probable work of the Winklevoss twins.\n\nThe bees have just created a new cryptocurrency.\n\nThis is the future of blockchain.\n\nYou smile as you raise a spoonful of honey to your lips.\n",
