You open it, cautiously, and on the other side see Secret Service agents, but not quite like your own. One grabs your bag, and the rest escort you to a large vehicle. Inside is JFK. Older, but without a doubt. JFK. You are in shock. \"I'm sorry if we have startled you Barack, but this is how it works.\" \n\nHe briefs you quickly - there are many alternate universes, with different timeline, histories, development, etc. all linked to your own. One of them is particularly advanced, and has been reaching out and \"borrowing\" US Presidents over the years, exchanging them through worlds to help solve problems and correct wrongs. And now it is your turn to play a part. You are given a dossier on the problems facing this alternate Earth, and told that you will be expected to act as necessary. \n\n\"Don't worry,\" says JFK \"You won't be gone too long, and they have some weird time manipulation tech too. No one will ever miss you, assuming you don't die on us.\"\n\nAs you exit the car, and prepare to head towards you new \"job\" you turn to JFK. \"So are you \"our\" JFK? Did you not really die? Or are you another JFK? What really happened?\" JFK just smiles. \n\n\"Maybe I'll tell you when you get back.\" \n\nAnd with that you head off, excited and filled with purpose.\n",
