But there are a few people, who remember the freedom, before the third World War.  \n\nUnbeknownst to the evil leaders, there is a resistance forming-seniors of all countries, discarded and ignored by the system, plan to fight a war for the future. They have nothing to lose, and an abundance of knowledge and experience. The freedom of their grandchildren depends on it! Thus begins the War of the Elders!\n\n\n\n",
