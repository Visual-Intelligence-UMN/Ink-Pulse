        "text": "All of the \"#1 Dad\" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly. You were given a #1 dad mug by your daughter, Harper, as a Father's Day gift last year. You now hold that mug in your hand. You study the ranking that the mug shows. Your heart starts to race as you move further and further down the list. Your eyes dart from the ranks at the top of list to your mug. You start sweating bullets and you start to feel very uncomfortable. It almost feels like you're having a stroke. You realize your name is nowhere to be found on this list of dads. You look to your mug again in disbelief. You double check your eyes to make sure this isn't a hallucination. You triple check. Then your mind starts racing back to your wife Soeurette's pregnancy with Harper. When Soeurette had shared the news with you that she was pregnant, she was already about 5 months along. But thinking back on the situation, Soeurette had been with her brother, your best friend, Kaitlyn's husband, that one weekend that you were both out of town at a beer fest. You had ended up getting called onto an emergency work trip that weekend and you had left the beer fest early. You remember that Soeurette had asked you to take a picture of her brother in the beer bikini that she had made for him. She had seemed overly flirtatious with him. You remember her warmth and closeness to him as the two of them interacted. You realize with great discomfort that the beer fest occurred five months prior to her pregnancy announcement. You begin to feel the pangs of jealousy and rage flood through your veins. You begin to feel mortified at the realization that Soeurette had cheated on you with Kaitlyn's husband, your best friend. You start to investigate the mug again. You see that your best friend is listed as the 30th best dad in the world. You feel your heart sink. Your best friend doesn't have any kids with Kaitlyn, but now you are certain that he is Harper's father. You realize that you have been absolutely used and cheated on. You are disgusted with Soeurette. You throw the mug against the wall and it shatters. Soeurette comes to ask you what's wrong and you tell her you know that she cheated on you and that Harper is not your child. She denies it at first, but you are able to prove to her that you have figured everything out. She breaks down and confesses her sins. She begs you to try and forgive her. She tells you that she loves you and that she still wants to be with you. You think to yourself, \"how can I stay with this woman who has cheated on me and used me?\" You kick Soeurette out of your life and let her fend for herself as a single mom to Harper. She lives a very miserable and unhappy life after that and is never able to find another man willing to trust her. \n",
