So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.\n\nThe 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, \"dude.\" The 92nd little pig, Frank, said \"Yeah, I know, not a great idea. But I have 91 older brothers and sisters. It seems like they have tried everything possible to make their fortune. What am I supposed to do?\"\n\nThe wolf said \"Well, you could try making a house out of something that is not radioactive.\"\n\nFrank sighed. \"You're right I'll demolish this one and just build a regular house I guess. But I still need to find a way to make my fortune!\"\n\nThe wolf said \"Well, I have an idea. You could build a house out of something that is not radioactive and then you could sell it to people who are not radioactive.\"\n\nFrank looked at him, a little irritated. \"You have to be joking, right? You know my three oldest brothers have the most successful house building company in town. One is the architect, one does the manual labor, and the other does security. There's no way I could make my fortune with them in town.\"\n\nAnd the wolf said, \"Exactly.\" \n\nFrank said \"What do you mean, 'Exactly'?\"\n\n\"There's no way you can be successful in _this_ town. You guys do know there is a whole world out there, right?\"\n\nFrank said \"Yeah, I know, but there's no way I could get to the other side of the world.\"\n\nThe wolf stared at the little pig. \"Now you're joking, right?\" Frank looked at him, a little confused and not at all joking. \"You're not joking. Ok, I don't know what your mom has told you, or what fairy tale books you have been reading. But you don't need to go to \"the other side of the world.\" There's another town 10 miles to the north, and another 7 miles southeast. And dozens of others in a 150 mile radius.\"\n\nFrank looked at the wolf, still a little confused. The wolf decided to take pity on him. It was his fault the pigs' mom was so paranoid that she hadn't told her kids about the wider world.\n\n\"Ok, look, I'll show you. Go pack up - sell anything you can't carry. And don't forget to demolish that depleted uranium house too.\"\n\nFrank went home and packed up his stuff.\n",

Frank was amazed when they got there. Not by the people, or how wonderful the town was. \n",
