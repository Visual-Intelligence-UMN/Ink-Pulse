        "text": "An alien has kidnapped Matt Damon, not knowing what lengths humanity goes through to retrieve him whenever he goes missing. People panic and look to the governments of the world for answers. All the while, Matt Damon is forced to live in a strange world with an even stranger alien. He is angry about all the deliberation going on in the world, and no action to save him. \n\nWhen the alien's wife is kidnapped by humans, and a daring rescue is staged, Matt Damon becomes more than an unwilling prisoner. He suddenly becomes a prisoner of war. The aliens torture him relentlessly. Having no concept of time, he loses track of how long he's been on this strange alien's planet. He begins to look back over his life and realizes that he has played so many different characters, he never thought that he would live a real life scenario like this, in front of the whole world. He gathers his composure and decides that he will act, and give his best performance, as a hero. He will save the world from the alien that has taken him.\n\nHe requests an audience with the head alien and promises to divulge everything he knows about Earth's defenses at the meeting. The aliens agree and take him to their leader. Matt Damon is placed on the ground in front of the alien leader and a translator. He begins by complimenting the alien leader on his command over his people. He then launches into a scene he had prepared for the occasion. He grabs the alien leader's antenna, which is apparently a symbol of his power, and throws it to the ground. He screams, \"Freedom!\" so loudly that he startles the guards. He then takes a step back and launches into a scene where his character, the hero, is yelling at the alien leader.\n\nHe tells the alien leader that the people of Earth will never surrender! He proclaims that they will fight to the last man, woman and child! The alien leader picks up his torn antennae and grabs Matt in one hand and lifts him over his head. He stares into Matt's eyes and tells him that the aliens had taken him because he is an advocate for environmentalism. He says that the people of Earth had no concept of how to interact with their world. The purpose of taking Matt was to give him the knowledge to protect the natural environment of the planet. The fight didn't start until Earthlings kidnapped his wife. \n",
