How about some orange juice\" I asked. Just like that, the bee flew over and grabbed a bottle of orange juice from the hand of some little girl. To be honest this was my favorite part of the day. This little bee literally snatched this orange juice like a grown man. Just as i was handed the orange juice by the bee, i woke up from my dream. Only i didnt know it was a dream. Well, look forward to going to sleep tomorrow i guess!\n",
