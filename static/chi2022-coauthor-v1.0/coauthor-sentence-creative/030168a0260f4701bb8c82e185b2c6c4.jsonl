        "text": "An alien has kidnapped Matt Damon, not knowing what lengths humanity goes through to retrieve him whenever he goes missing. This alien is named Soeurette and comes from the planet called Doozy. Soeurette kidnaps Matt Damon for his immense talent of playing the ukulele. She is so impressed with Matt Damon's ukulele playing abilities that she forces him to play at all of her parties on planet Doozy. And so the game begins, Matt Damon must escape from planet Doozy by playing the ukulele and over a period of years, becomes a ukulele playing slave to Soeurette. The game is called Ukulele Hero. The more difficult songs he plays the more points he earns toward his freedom from planet Doozy and from his master, Soeurette. \n\nIt is here that Matt Damon must face his greatest challenge. Yes, Matt Damon had a challenging career back on planet Earth but on planet Doozy it is a whole different story. Matt Damon must master such exotic ukulele songs as \"The Entertainer\", \"Smoke on the Water\", and \"This Land Is Your Land.\" Soeurette is a very demanding alien to entertain. She frequently throws parties as she gets married every two years to a different alien. Matt Damon must play a song every couple of minutes at these parties or Soeurette will start to get angry. \n\nMany hundreds of years pass and Matt Damon is still playing songs for Soeurette on his ukulele. Matt Damon is very anxious to escape from planet Doozy as he has had enough of being a slave to Soeurette. Matt Damon has almost reached the end of his ukulele playing days and is very close to freedom. The only thing that stands in his way is the hardest song he has ever played on planet Doozy; \"The Way We Were.\" He practices this song until his fingers and vocals ache. He nails the chords and makes sure that he has his rhythm down pat. Matt Damon is ready for his moment to shine. \n\nThe time has come for Matt Damon to face Soeurette and play her his finest ukulele performance. The occasion for this performance is Soeurette's 500th wedding ceremony. Yes, she has really cycled through that many male aliens over the years since she can never be in a stable relationship. This ceremony will be ultimate for Matt Damon and his ukulele playing abilities. Matt Damon walks out in front of the crowds and plays his heart out. He plays the chords perfectly and nails his rhythm. \n\nThe crowd looks on in utter amazement at Matt Damon's ukulele playing abilities. They are blown away. He finishes the song and the crowd erupts in applause. Matt Damon looks at Soeurette, trying to read her mind. Is this it? Does he get his freedom now? Soeurette smiles at Matt Damon, signifying that she is impressed with his performance. Matt Damon's heart beats faster with excitement. He can almost taste freedom. He looks at Soeurette and she says \"That was very good, now go make me a sandwich!\"\n",

He knows that by her saying that his performance was very good, he has finally earned his freedom. He knows he can escape from planet Doozy and never have to deal with Soeurette again. So he politely declines her request to make a sandwich and tells her to enjoy the catering at her 500th wedding reception. And then, he happily skips back over to Earth, and returns to his friends and family. \n",
