The people of earth are gaining on the alien and Matt Damon, and the alien is in danger. Matt Damon tries to signal the people off but to no avail. The two need to find a way to either return Matt Damon more quickly, or signal to the earthlings that matt damon is ok. While being chased, the alien ends up fainting from over stimulation and Matt is forced to drive the ship. Matt swerves around multiple times and ends up coming to a stop on a random planet. Matt runs out with his hands up, signaling that he is ok. He screams for everyone to hold their fire, and that the alien inside is nice. The earthlings hold their fire, but pull their guns out again as soon as the alien walks out. The earthlings ultimately meet the alien, and agree to terms to allow matt damon to return home. The alien is given protection from the earthlings, and is also able to come back to earth to introduce himself to the humans personally.\n",
