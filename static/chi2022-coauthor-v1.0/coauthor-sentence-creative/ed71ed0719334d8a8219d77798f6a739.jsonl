The throne in the middle of the room is empty. But then, the throne begins to shake and a light fills the room. From the light comes a loud, booming voice. It said, \"I am the guardian of this cave. Are you here to guard the cave?\" \n\n\"No,\" the three friends replied. \"We were just exploring.\"\n\n\"You are not here to guard the cave?\" the voice said. \"We are in need of someone new to watch over the cave. If not you, then who?\" \n\nWithout hesitation, one of the friends stepped forward.\n",
