She seemed more happy and more energetic than me. After all, she died way earlier than me. I felt happy for her because she didn't have to worry about problems like me. After some time that we were talking, she asked me, \"How about you?\"\n\n\"How about me, what?\" I asked.\n\n\"How did you die?\" she said.\n\nThat is the question that I was dreading to answer. I did not have a carefree life the way she had. I was always worried about the future, I was always thinking about what would happen if I did this or that. I was worried about my mortgage, my bills, the people around me. In the end, I had too much of it and decided to end my life.\n\n\"I.. I committed suicide.\" I regrettably said to her.  Understandably she got very quiet. Her face suddenly felt that it was sad and she started to cry.\n",
