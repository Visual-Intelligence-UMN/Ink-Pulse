It tasted terrible, but she powered through it and finished the potion. She felt an odd power surging inside her, and she realized it was her body absorbing the Mana around her. She then spoke the spells incantation, \"Illuminatium\" and watched in amazement as light filled her dark room. She had learned and cast her first spell. She felt more motivated to continue reading the rest of the book, and hopefully being able to wield more types of magical spells.\n\nAs she continued to read the book, she learned more and more spells. She learned basic spells such as creating a ball of light, laying down a few yards of flames around her, creating water from the air and blowing things away with a gust of wind. She was quite proficient, truly capable to be called a witch. Yet, she kept the book and her new powers a secret from everyone else. She realized the danger that could occur should others learn the magic within, much less if someone decided to use the most dangerous spells the book claimed to teach. She decided to stay at home practicing her craft, while keeping up with her normal life. The book would remain in her possession indefinitely, believing it was fate that caused her to find it in the first place. However, she also made a new goal in her life once she was done mastering all the safe spells in the book. \n",

        "text": "Emily was a witch in training. That is what she claimed however, as on most days she worked 9-5 at a local bookstore owned by her friend. Rather, she claimed to others to be a witch, with terribly powerful spells and incantations, in a world where magic doesn't exist. For the most part, many didn't believe her and found her to be too weird to hang out with. It worked fine for Emily, who was an introverted girl who kept to herself, often spending her free time alone with a good book. That is, until she stumbled onto a mysterious book hidden in her friend's bookstore one day.\n\nShe had come to the bookstore one night after work after leaving her house key, and ended up finding a hidden section of books that could be found only if you knew the exact location. She was mystified, she had been around the book store countless times, and even her friend did not tell her of this section. She believed it was just an ordinary book section, with other types of reading material. Looking through the books, she found they had intricate designs on their book spines and cover, but lacked any titles. Confused, she picked up a few. Opening each one showed the same outcome, the books were all blank. Every book in the section had no words written in them, except one that she found that looked out of place.\n\nShe picked up a book with a rather simple design on its cover, with a blue background and three circles orbiting around the center circle. Unlike the other books in the section, the book was titled, being called, \"Mana Invictum\". Being interested in the title, Emily opened the book and found it had text in it. More than that, it had writing in English, and wasn't just gibberish. The book was a magic book, that taught the user how to tap into Mana and wield magic. She was giddy with excitement, she would finally learn how to use spells like a witch.\n\nShe took the book home with her, and studied it for days. The book was complex on some parts, especially with some spells the book claimed was too dangerous to wield. Emily opted to learn a much more simpler spell to use, a spell that could illuminate her surroundings. Learning the correct ingredients to brew the spell's potion, she then drank it eagerly. It tasted terrible, but she powered through it and finished the potion. She felt an odd power surging inside her, and she realized it was her body absorbing the Mana around her.
