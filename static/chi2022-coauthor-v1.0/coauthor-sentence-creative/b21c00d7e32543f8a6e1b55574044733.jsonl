I wanted to know his ranking, it was starting to pop up in my head unexpectedly.  But I didn't want to ask him.  I didn't want to make a big deal out of it in case it was a low number.  I didn't want to make him feel bad.  So I decided to wait until the holidays when I went home.\n\nThe last day of school was finally here.  I loaded my car and drove three hours to my parent's home.  When I got there, I hugged my parents.  They were so glad to see me, and we spent the evening chatting and catching up.  I got up early the next morning before anyone else was up.  I was so curious, I started going through the cabinets looking for my dad's #1 Dad mug.  I know he had one; I had gotten it for him when I was 5 or 6.  But I couldn't find it anywhere.  I searched the kitchen, the living room, the dining room, and the basement.  I didn't realize that someone was in the room with me as I was searching through the hall closet.\n\n\"Son,\" I heard my mom say.  \"Can I help you find something?\"\n\nI turned around, looking guilty.  \"Umm, I was just looking for something,\" I said.\n\n\"You're looking for your dad's #1 Dad mug, aren't you?\" she asked?  \"There's been so much made of that.  I'm glad your father's got broken a couple of years ago.  Ridiculous.  Like anyone could rate dads!  Sure, you can categorize them, but put them in order?  There's definitely not one number one dad. All that matters is how YOU feel about your dad, not a number\"\n\nI was relieved. My mom put into words what I had been thinking. It didn't matter if my dad was ranked number 1 or number 50 or number 2, 987,334.  He was my dad and I loved him, and he would always be number one to me no matter what a mug said.\n",
