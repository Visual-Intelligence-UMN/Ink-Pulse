Many famous movie stars announce that it is totally woke to be Chinese.\n\nAmerican culture, movies, and music are all illegal. But if the actors and actresses learn Chinese they can act in propaganda movies and plays, so all is not lost. The Academy Award that year goes to \"Bean Paste Diaries,\" starring several unknown members of the proletariat.\n\nThe United States is reduced to a third-world country. Large red bulldozers flatten McMansions everywhere, and they are replaced by rows of tents. President Trump is sent to a prison camp in Alaska where he works on a chain gang.\n\nThe invaders seem to like Donald Trump Junior, however, and appoint him Minister of Pharmaceuticals. He gets to play with all sorts of mood-enhancing chemicals and poisons, and tells funny stories about how his daddy used to call him \"Little Rocket Man\" and had one of his assistants rock him when his father slurped Diet Cokes.\n\nThe Chinese also like Ivanka. She is appointed First Concubine of the Imperial Leader, and tasked with reducing bullying by Americans against the Chinese.\n\nAs for the American people, they are placed in a giant theme park where they work to build more theme parks. A 25-mile rollercoaster called \"The Long March\" opens between Pasadena and the Hollywood Hills. No one knows why, but most of the people who try the ride are never seen again.\n\nOn the bright side, at least the Chinese remember what a hamburger is. For just 22 Renminbi, you can but a 1 ounce, half-inch plastic replica of one. It comes with a side of fries that is really just a bunch of chopped up radishes.\n\nDiet Cokes are illegal everywhere.\n\nExcept, of course, Alaska!\n",
