Please go now!\" \n\n\"Please let me in,\" pleaded the wolf. The pig simply locked and bolted the door shut, and closed all of the curtains. The pig was far too busy for this nonsense. The pig got back to work. \n\n\"Little pig, little pig, let me come in,\" said the wolf. The pig did not answer. The wolf tried to open the door, but it was locked. \"Little pig, little pig, let me come in,\" said the wolf, with waning energy. The pig ignored him. The wolf whimpered. \"Little pig,\" he gasped. \"Little pig, let me come in,\" he wheezed. The pig continued to ignore him. The pig was far too busy to deal with this silliness. The wolf felt like he was going to cry. \"Little pig,\" he sobbed. \"Little pig,\" he cried. \"Little pig, let me come in,\" he wailed. The pig was unmoved.\n",
