She took it and read the label. \"Anyone that drinks it can transform into whatever they want. All I've ever wanted was to be yours.\" \n\n\"I don't know what to say,\" she said. She shrugged, closed her eyes, and took a sip. She opened her eyes, and saw that she had transformed into a man. Her date gasped in horror. \"What's wrong?\" she asked. \"I'm gonna show you what it's like having to put up with dating men.\"\n",
