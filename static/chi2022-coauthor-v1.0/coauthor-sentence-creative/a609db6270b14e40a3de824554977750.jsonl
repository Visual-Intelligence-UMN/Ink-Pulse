However, much to the surprise of Matt Damon, the alien did not kidnap him out of nefarious reasons. Rather, the alien kidnapped him out of the weirdest reason Matt Damon could ever had heard from. As the alien had told him, the alien is trying to get home, but he's not sure how.\n\n\"But how am I suppose to help with that?\", replied Matt Damon. \"I'm an actor, not a scientist or an astronaut.\"\n\n\"Well, you're the only person I know who's been to space and back, so I'm hoping you can help me,\" said the alien in turn.\n\nMatt Damon was thoroughly confused, wondering what the alien meant by that.\n\nSuddenly the alien, pulled out a familiar DVD case, with his face on the front.\n\n\"This is you on this video correct, you were trapped on Mars and managed to make it back to Earth in this video,\" the alien stated with a gleam of hope in its five eyes.\n\n\"Yes, but that was just a movie,\" Matt Damon replied. He couldn't believe an alien would think his role in The Martian were what actually happened to him.\n\nThe alien looked puzzled, and confused at what Matt Damon said, evidently not knowing what a movie is.\n\nRegardless, Matt Damon took pity on the alien and decided to humor his niavety. Telling the alien he would help him, Matt Damon decided to make some phone calls to some friends. He soon got in touch with famous astronomers, and physicists. Matt Damon orchestrated a meeting with top scientists at NASA, who were still in the dark for the real reason he decided to give them a visit.\n\nMatt Damon and the alien met with the scientists at NASA, where they were given a tour of the facility while the alien was disguised as a human. Near the end of the tour, Matt Damon met privately with rocket scientists, and revealed the identity of his friend.\n\n\"I know you guys are working on a way to get to Mars, and I was hoping you could help us,\" Matt Damon told the scientists, after revealing the alien\".\n\nThe alien shocked the scientists, who after being startled began analyzing and studying the alien up close.\n\n\"But think of the scientific discovery of a real life alien on Earth, \" one of the scientists proclaimed.\n\n\"I know, but he's not here to be studied, he's here to get home,\" Matt Damon replied.\n\nBegrudgingly, the scientist agreed, realizing it was unethical to keep an alien against its will. They revealed a top secret project, a hi tech rocket ship that could make it to Mars faster than any other craft made on Earth, albeit a one way trip at the moment.\n\nMatt Damon and the alien were given a tour of the ship, which was built to withstand the harsh conditions of space. To their suprise, the ship was ready to launch and could send the alien home in a couple of minutes.\n\nWith that, Matt Damon turned to the alien, and said his good byes. He wished him well, and thought to himself of what kind of family the alien had back home on Mars.\n\nThe alien, in turn, thanked Matt Damon for everything he had done for him.\n",

Climbing into the ship, the alien was soon launched into the sky, while Matt Damon and the scientists viewed from the safety of the control room. Soon the alien exited the Earth's orbit, and flew into the vastness of space. Eyeing the window from the cockpit, the alien soon saw the planet Mars. Elated, they were finally returning home. They would be back with their family, who were worried sick of their absence. The alien would have much to tell to them, especially of their human friend that they made on Earth, the famous astronaut named Matt Damon.\n",
