If you stung me, would I die?\" \n\n\"You would, but I would die with you,\" said the bee.\n\n\"Okay, please don't sting me then.\" \n\nThe bee flew away.\n\nIt's now been many months since I saw the bee, or any bee. I wonder if I imagined the whole conversation.  I must have.  I even tried to tell the others about the bee, but they all thought I was crazy. After all, why would I believe a tiny bee could talk? \n\nA few days later, I was stung by a bee. I was fine.  I didn't die.  It just stung a little bit.  The bee died, but it didn't talk this time.  It was just a normal bee.  No other be ever tried to talk to me again. \n",
