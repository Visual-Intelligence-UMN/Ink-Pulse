        "text": "You're Barack Obama. 4 years into your retirement, you awake to find a letter with no return address on your bedside table. It reads \"I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job.\" Signed simply, \"JFK.\"\n\n\n\nYou have no idea what JFK could mean by this, but you're intrigued. After all, hasn't JFK been dead for many years? Hesitantly, you call the number he's given in the letter and you speak to him. A man answers and you are surprised that the man's voice is the one of a healthy middle-aged adult. If JFK were alive, he'd be ancient by now and his voice would be gravelly and raspy. It would not be as vibrant as it is on the phone. \n\n\n\nNonetheless, you speak to the man who claims to be JFK. This man tells you to meet him in Bermuda. JFK tells you that he's sending a plane for you. You are completely mystified and stupefied. You ask if Michelle can come along. \"No, it's just you.\" You protest that you can go nowhere without Michelle, and that she will most certainly be suspicious that you are having an affair if you go off to Bermuda on a random whim without notifying her at all. \"I'm sorry Barack, but you have to do this alone,\" JFK says. \"You have no choice in the matter.\"\n\nThat night, you go home to Michelle and tell her that you have received a strange letter asking that you travel out to Bermuda, and that you must fulfill the obligations under the letter alone. You make up some nonsense about a new job. Michelle can see right through your lies. She knows that you don't have a new job. After all, you are happily retired. Your life is so much more calm and less stressful now. Why would you throw all of that away just because of a job offer? Your career is done and you know it and she knows it. This is a lie.\n\nMichelle starts to ask questions. You are evasive. After all, you barely have any details about this job yourself, so you certainly aren't in a position to share such details with her! You deflect questions about the job and try to change the subject. Eventually, Michelle gives up. She knows that you wouldn't be pressing to go to Bermuda alone if you didn't have a very good and very legitimate reason for doing so. So she leaves the issue and heads up to bed. \n\n\n\nThe next morning, the mansion staff are gathered and ready to chauffeur you to the airport. Off you go to Bermuda! The lines at the airport are short and you are surprised to be on the plane in under an hour from the time you set foot in the airport. When you touch down in Bermuda, you are shocked to see JFK waiting for you. He's alive! JFK greets you warmly. He tells you that he needs your help to do something tremendously important, and that it's up to you to stop a major threat. You are very concerned and ask what the issue is. He says he is trying to negotiate a cross-border peace treaty with Bermuda and that he needs your help. You immediately jump in to offer your help. It's not everyday that JFK will ask you to help with diplomatic relations! With your help, JFK is able to successfully resolve the matter. Peace is restored again to both nations.\n",
