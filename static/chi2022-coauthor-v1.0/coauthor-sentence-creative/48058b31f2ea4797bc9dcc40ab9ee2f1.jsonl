After a long silence, the clerk finally spoke. \"Very good, sir. If you'll come with me, I'll show you our available selection.\" \n\nMurray follows the clerk to the back of the store. The back room was filled with rows of what looked like dressing rooms, each with a curtain hanging on a rod. The clerk stopped in front of one of the curtains. It said \"#47\" on it. The clerk pulled the curtain aside and motioned for Murray to step inside. Murray pulled aside the curtain, and was astonished to find a small room completely filled with mugs. Each and every mug was different and unique. No two were alike. Every single mug said \"#47\" on it. Murray was amazed. He looked around the room, and then looked at the clerk. \"This is your number this year, Mr. Lowell, and you can choose from any of these.\" \n",
