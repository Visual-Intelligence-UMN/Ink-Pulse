After Ben Aflack was abducted and taken away to and unknown place in the universe, Matt Damon became the most liked person in the world. The whole world votes every year on the most likable person in the world and Matt Damon has won every year since Ben Aflack was taken 4 years before. Now before Ben Aflack it was Tom Hanks who held the honor but he was dragged into middle earth by some trolls but thats another story. \nNow this is the second time aliens have tried to take our beloved Matt from us. We went and fought an intergalactic war and won just to get him back. This time it is said he is being held in the center of a star which only one civilization is capable of. We call them the Red Skulls because their heads look like red skulls. They have the technology to enter and travel through stars and have placed Matt in the center of a white hot super giant (star). \nThe best minds of earth devised a plan. They could blow up the star, destroying the alien home world all while saving our Matt. \n\n",

We managed to hack the alien's computer system at their old embassy on Earth and get the blue prints for their sun traveling ships. Earth then modified the design and sent a small group of special space forces to save him. \nThey entered the alien solar system undetected, made it to the star's corona with no problems and managed to grab Matt, drop a dark matter bomb and shoot back off undetected. This gave earth back its most liked person in the world but little did they know it was only a clone and one of millions now inhabiting the real alien home world.\n",
