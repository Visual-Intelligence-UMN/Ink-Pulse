The rate at which they aged was itself slowing down, and only recently had they reached the point where they truly did stop aging.  \n\nYou and the rest of the Lost Generations are now the only ones who are aging normally, and the younger people who took the drug still appear to be young and healthy.  However, in recent years, it has become clear that they are actually now aging in reverse.  They are moving backwards through their growth cycles very slowly, but the age at which they are going back is increasing steadily over time.  \n\nIf this trend continues the same way as it did when the drug was preventing aging, then eventually, they will all become babies again!  \n\nThe only hope for humanity is that these \"young\" people start to quickly have as many children as they can.  They all just have to hope that their children will age normally, just like the unlucky lost generation who never got to take the drug.  \n\nThe only source of comfort that you have in your old age is that you won't be around long enough to see the terrible impact that this side effect has on the world as a whole.\n\nYou are also glad that enough time has passed that people don't remember who you are.  If you thought they were mad when they couldn't get the drug, you can't imagine how mad the people will be when they learn what your miracle drug really accomplished.\n\n\"Thank god for our short lifetimes\", you think to yourself.\n\nYou turn off the news, and decide to take a long nap.\n\n\nTHE END\n",
