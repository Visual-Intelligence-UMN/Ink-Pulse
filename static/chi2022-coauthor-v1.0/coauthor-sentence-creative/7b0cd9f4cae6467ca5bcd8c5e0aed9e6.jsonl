As a result, China has become the most powerful nation on Earth. The United States decides to reclaim its power. In the process of doing so, they attempt to overthrow the government of China and replace it with a new one. Their attempts to overthrow the Chinese government are futile. In retaliation, China declares war on the United States. The Chinese empire has grown too strong and too powerful. The United States cannot compete. The United States government, in an attempt to save the country, takes drastic measures. The United States decides the most drastic yet logical thing to do is to surrender to the Chinese empire. In exchange for the United States' surrender, China will not continue on to conquer the world. However, the United States must adopt all Chinese culture and abandon American ways of life. \n\nThe United States agrees to the terms. The United States becomes known as the New Atlantic China and develops a new currency that is entirely crypto. The United States is put under Chinese rule. All burger restaurants are replaced with noodle bars.   English is no longer taught in schools. Everything that once said \"Made in China\" now says \"Produced in the Motherland.\" The United States is heavily censored by the Chinese government. There is no national anthem anymore and no one plays sports. Instead, the Chinese empire has sponsored a new futuristic sport. It is a sport that consists of two teams battling it out with laser beams. The sport turns out to be a huge hit among former Americans and many people take it on as a new hobby. \n",
