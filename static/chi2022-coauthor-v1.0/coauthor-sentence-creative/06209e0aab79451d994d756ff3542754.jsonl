So they came out first, looking for help. But but about 5 years in even the larger countries came out, after protests and government turnover forced the issue.\"\n\n\"So what does that all mean, where do we stand?\"\n\nThe first advisor spoke up again, \"Well sir...we have no standing. As you can see, the rest of the world has continued to advance. And judging by the communications we received in response to our return greetings, they aren't actually all that interested in dealing with us. Sir, to be honest, they think we are weak and a liability.\"\n\n\"But we're an economic and military powerhouse!\" Shouted the President. \"We just need to show them...\"\n\nThe rest of the council shook their heads. Various voices spoke up \"After 50 years of self restraint, our people don't have the same energy...\" \"They know more than us now...\" \"Our newer generations lack drive...\"\n\nThen the High Minister of Isolation Planning and Maintenance spoke up, in a rather superior tone \"You know, even in the days leading up to the return we had many who said that it was a mistake. I myself campaigned to stay in isolation. Who knows what other diseases and moral contaminants have grown out there in our absence. But no one would listen. But the situation has changed and I have a new plan. We are going to take a page from the old Russians and continue to cultivate our ideals here in isolation. This time with the focus of coming out stronger, and more powerful than ever before. If you will all join me in my chambers you'll find I have a plan already drawn up...\"\n\nThree days later, the council approved the new isolation plan and announced a new 50 year isolation period, effective immediately and without exception. The rest of the world barely noticed. Life goes on.\n",
