        "text": "A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and one who is certain that he’s going to get it right this time.\n\nOver time, the woman started noticing commonalities between these men she has been dating. They had a lot in common, almost too much. She of course initially wrote this off as her having a 'type', but as more time passed, it was harder to deny the common threads between all of them. \n\nAs the woman noticed more and more, she could not help but become disillusioned and suspicious. She began to keep detailed records based on her suspicions. She didn't have any concrete theory to explain the patterns, but she knew something was amiss. \n\nOne day she had what seemed like a crazy idea, she came up with a sort of test to prove the patterns were not the result of mere coincidence. The woman decided to take a trip to the mountains with her dates as part of the test, and began to repeat a particular series of actions. She would observe how each man she dated reacted to this set of actions. \n\nThe woman was surprised to find that all of her dates reacted to the same set of actions in a similar way, perhaps even arguably, the very same way. She was certain that she had caught her dates in the act, or discovered something more inexplicable than having a \"type\". It had to be a conspiracy. \n\nSo confounded by what to do next, the woman decided to confront her last date about it. She revealed her past experiences with the men she dated and the test she subjected them to. The man was shocked, and at first denied everything, but he was also growing desperate as his attempts never ended in success. He finally decided to admit to the woman that he was a shapeshifter, and that he was in love with her. He thought that if anything, no one would ever believe her. To his surprise, the woman believed him, and was even more intrigued. Finally, it was through honesty that their relationship was given the chance to truly grow and the woman fell in love with the \"real\" him. \n",
