Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. \n\nAlso, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous. If everyone were to be more informed, and more aware of the world around them, I think that we could make a huge difference. To exist, and act without being informed about the possible consequences of your actions is irresponsible at best. \n\nFinally, people are always saying that they want a better world, that there are problems that must be solved, etc. But they don't do anything about it. Just being informed is the first step, and one that is easy enough that there is no justification not to do so. Being informed is the best way to start creating the world you want to live in.\n\nIn short, being informed about current events is the responsible thing to do. If you want to be a part of society, have opinions, and take actions the only choice is to be informed so that you do right and make good choices. It will not only help you be a better person, but will help you make the world a better place. \n",
