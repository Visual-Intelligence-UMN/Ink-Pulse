Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, there is no line that can be drawn that can tell me or anyone else that something is too dangerous. We all get to decide that.\n\nI think extreme mountain climbing is very dangerous and I know tons of people die each year trying to climb Mount Everest. That sport would be way too extreme and dangerous for me. I'd draw the line there. But even with that information being public, there are still tons of people that go to hike that Mountain each year. \n\nI also wouldn't go snowboarding or skiing. Those are less dangerous and exteme sports but I have no interest in risking breaking a bone or getting severely hurt. \n\nThe great thing about our life is that we get to make our own choices and our own decisions. We get that freedom and we also have to deal with the consequences that come from those decisions.\n\nThere's nothing that can really happen other than a severe death rate that would make me consider something too extreme for the public. I mean there are people who climb up buildings just for fun. There are people who jump out of planes. There are a lot of adrenaline junkies in our world. I am whatever the opposite of that is. I love to be relaxed, boots on the ground and as safe as can be. \n\nWhen you break it down, all sports have some danger in them. You can get hit with a baseball or a hockey puck. You can have a bad landing in basketball. You can get concussed in football by tackling someone. Everyone knows those risks. There is danger to basically everything in life when you think about it. Danger is also a thing that is defined differently by everyone. I may find something dangerous that many others don't and vice versa. \n\nWhen it comes down to it, we all make our own definitions of the words danger and extreme. We all get to choose what is too dangerous and extreme for us personally, but we can't tell others how to live their life. \n",
