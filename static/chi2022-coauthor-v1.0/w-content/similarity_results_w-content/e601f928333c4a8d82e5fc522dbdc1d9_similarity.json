        "sentence": "Is It Selfish to Pursue Risky Sports Like Extreme Mountain Climbing?\n\nSome sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, it is up to an individual to decide what risks are appropriate when it comes to extreme sports. I am of the belief that you have a right to play whatever sport you want to play, just as long as you are personally willing to accept whatever happens. And no, it is not selfish. \nMountain climbing can be a very rewarding activity, both physically and mentally. A lot of people benefit from the focus and presence it takes to perform such an a task. The sense of accomplishment one can feel from a challenging climb can be life enriching, so much that a select few even devote their life to it. Surely challenging yourself is not selfish. \nMany extreme sports that are risky are far less risky with proper training and gear. If a person takes the time to learn these things and use helmets and pads when it applies, or let's say learn to climb using the proper gear and techniques then the risk factor of the activity goes way down. Many accidents occur not because of the sport itself, but because it was done wrong. It is not selfish or nearly as risky to take the proper precautions. \nA suppose a line can be drawn in some cases, where people are just looking for a thrill by doing something likely to hurt them. I have seen the Tik-Tok videos of people up to some pretty crazy things just to get a thrill, like jumping off of a roof onto a trampoline, or someone trying to take a motorbike up a poorly constructed ramp and I don't think these are sports at all and do not apply to what I have discuss. Let's not confuse childish stunts with extreme sports that are more mindfully executed. \nIn conclusion, no, it is not selfish at all to pursue risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. They are enjoyed by many and people that enjoy them do so because of the challenge benefit they experience, and in my opinion that is not selfish.\n",
