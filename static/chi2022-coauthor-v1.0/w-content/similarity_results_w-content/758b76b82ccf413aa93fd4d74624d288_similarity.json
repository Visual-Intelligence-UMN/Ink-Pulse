Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading it and maybe even better. Everyone has their own preference, however i like being able to listen to a book because it allows me to do other things while i listen. When you are physically reading a book, you cannot really multitask. When you have four kids, two dogs, and a wife you are really just trying to be as efficient as you can throughout the day. Being able to plug in and hear a nice book while doing house work or walking the dogs is great! I feel i am able to improve myself as a person without stressing myself out over loosing time for tasks. Not only this, but it has given me a full library of books to choose from that i would need to physically go to the library to have access to. Another reason i personally prefer audiobooks is the fact that the titles are cheaper to buy on the audiobook platform than they are to buy physical copies for. This is a no brainer since it costs to print the actual book. So to me, it is really all pros when it comes to audiobooks, and they fit into my life like a puzzle piece. \n",

If you have a busy lifestyle and still want to be able to continue learning i really think audiobooks are the way to go. There are no real disadvantages for me personally. This being said i understand the perspective of someone who would prefer physically reading a book. Being able to immerse yourself in the book in complete silence is a very therapeutic experience. This alone by itself may be something that helps enhances someone's calm and i understand that. Not everyone likes to multi task all the time, and for some people reading is just something that allows them to get their minds off of things and focus on one thing. I have had my moments like this, and for this situation maybe reading is the way to go, or even using an audiobook and just closing your eyes. I am a very overactive person, so the thought of not being productive can stress me out. This is why i like using the audiobooks when i am doing other things. I feel i get more of the book when i listen when going for a drive or for a run. If you are pushing yourself during a run sometimes all you want to think about is the book to not think about how you are running up this gigantic hill and you have more hills to go. \n",
