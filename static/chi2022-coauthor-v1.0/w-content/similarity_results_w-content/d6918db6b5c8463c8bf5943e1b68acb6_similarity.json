I think it MIGHT just be a prank. So... what to do next?\n\n\n",

He gets on the radio, held to his belt loop, calls in a couple of other agents, and coordinates with them.  I stand beside him and he says; \"Let's go sir\", we leave, headed god knows where, but my resolve that this is not real slowly dissolves.
