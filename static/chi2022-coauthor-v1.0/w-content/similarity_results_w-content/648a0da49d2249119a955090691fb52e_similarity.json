They had resolved to input all of the information about their dads into a predetermined algorithm that would collate the dads by who was best. They then had resolved to replace the #1 Dad\" mugs at the same time. Thus, Task Force Papa One was dissolved having solved the mystery and each father knew how good of a father he really was.
