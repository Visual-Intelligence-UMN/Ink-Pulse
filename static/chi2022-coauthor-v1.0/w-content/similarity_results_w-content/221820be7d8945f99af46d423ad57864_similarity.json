However, the pandemic has also shown that we should be more aware of our screen use, and take breaks from staring at screens. Being too dependent on social interactions online can affect the mood and temperament of an individual. Social interactions in person is still critical for many people, who require such interactions to feel connected and to have a stable mood. Thus, it is key that people find a balance in their life, especially during the pandemic and other times where they are unable to interact with others in person to moderate their screen use, to maximize its benefits and reduce its drawbacks. Most people have the ability to moderate themselves and avoid incurring negative health consequences, people in society have the means to learn how and resources should be available. For that, I believe it is unnecessary for most to worry about the dangers of dependency on digital devices and screen use. \n",
