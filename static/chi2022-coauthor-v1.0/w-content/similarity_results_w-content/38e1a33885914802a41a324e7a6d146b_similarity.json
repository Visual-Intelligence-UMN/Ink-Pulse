We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. \n\nIn this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many \"stay at home moms anymore\". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown. When I think of women staying home and taking care of a family I picture my grandmother, who is long gone, ironing and cooking everyday. This is not something we see now, so why do they still portray it on television shows? I think this is a stereotype that could cause some damage if it is not removed soon, especially if these shows are watched by young and impressionable girls.\n\nIf I had young children I certainly would not want them watching shows that give off the impression that women should stay home and care for the family. I would want my children, both boys and girls, to realize that women can do whatever men can do, and they can do it just as well. I want them to know women are capable and I do not want the stereotype put in their heads that women are not meant to work outside the home. We need to show young kids that women can do whatever they want, and that they can be whatever the equivalent of a man is. It is definitely time to get rid of the stereotype that women belong inside the home. It is 2020, not 1940, let's move on!\n",
