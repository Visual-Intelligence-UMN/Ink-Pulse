How so?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, online dating is a great way to quickly find partners that are more compatible with you then if you were just trying to find someone based on your much smaller social circle. You can find people with very specific interest that you can not find on your own. The sheer number of potential matches on dating sites far out numbers the amount of people you will consider dating in person by several orders of magnitude. Dating apps also have algorithms that help match you with potential partners that are very close to what you are looking for or how compatible you may potentially be with a person. These algorithms are highly effective. People are also looking at you. You will be contacted by potential partners as well. So its not just one way. Then you can get to know one another a bit before the first date if that is what you want to do.\n",

I believe it is now the most efficient and smart way to choose a potential partner. Its much better then luck and that is usually all you have to work with when out in the world looking for love. On a dating app luck plays its part but not nearly as much. The the two of you can use your devices to get to know each other before and while dating. Makes so much more sense overall.\n",
