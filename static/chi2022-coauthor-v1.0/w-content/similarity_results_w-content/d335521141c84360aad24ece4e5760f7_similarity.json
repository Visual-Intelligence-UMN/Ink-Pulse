I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and that it is our responsibility as citizens to be informed. \n\nInformed citizens make better decisions that benefit everyone because they have more knowledge about the lives of other people. This can even be beneficial for people in need. When folks are informed about a community in need through the news or some other source, only then can they act. \n\nIt's also good for citizens to keep up with what's current so they can be a more active and involved participant in their own government. It's hard to vote for how your community should be represented if you don't know a thing about the issues affecting your community. I don't see how someone could be a good citizen if they don't care enough about their fellow citizens to see what is affecting everyone. Engaging with current events is the only way to do this, so yes. We ARE being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. \n",
