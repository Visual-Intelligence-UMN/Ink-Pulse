Although animals may not be able to vocalize or ask for help, they nevertheless have the desire to live free from harm and the threats of death, just like people do. In any case, a person that focuses on one cause over the other is not necessarily uncaring towards the other cause. It is can very much be that they have chosen to focus on one cause over the other at a given point in their life, and they may help more humanitarian or animal welfare causes in the future. \n\nIt can be daunting for many to volunteer their time and donate money and resources for a variety of causes. Some may feel that their money might be wasted, or the particular charity they donated would be inefficient in utilizing their donations. For that reason, I think many chose to focus on one cause, such as animal welfare to reduce the time and effort on their behalf on researching whether their time and efforts are being adequately utilized to further the cause. In those instances, they are likely to make a greater impact on the cause they chose to focus on, than if they were to spread out their focus on several causes at once. As long as they take the time to better the welfare of either animals or humans, I think that is more impactful than if they were to not take the time to help at all. For many will invest their time, money, and resources towards the betterment of animals and humans. For that, I don't consider them unethical for focusing on one over the other, as they still are trying to resolve issues that affects many in the world, that requires immediate attention from those that can help.\n",
