Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, we aren't bad citizens at all if we don't keep up with the news. I personally hate watching the news simply because it is such a negative piece of media. Most of the stories are negative, and if I can avoid them I won't be upset by those stories.\n\nAnything that is super important we can't avoid news wise. For example the coronavirus was impossible to avoid. I'd see it pop up constantly on television and on social media. \n\nI don't think engaging in current events really does anything for us unless we are passionate about the event. Most people see a current event pop up on the news and never really think about it again unless it is personally having an affect on them. \n\nIt is not our responsibility to keep up with what is going on in the world. It is our responsibility to prioritize our life and our families life. That's my number one priority and that is never going to change.\n\nIf I am watching the news and see a murder story, a robbery, anything like that is not going to have a positive affect on my life. Knowing that information also isn't going to change my life in any way. So what is the point of me hearing that story?\n\nI think way too many people are obsessed with the idea of news more than the news itself. They're afraid of missing out on the hot topic that everyone is talking about. I personally don't care about any of that. I don't like to gossip anyway. I think that it's most important that we do what we love and surround ourselves with the ones we love.\n\nLike I said, if the news is really that urgent, we'll find out about it one way or the other. I haven't been a news person since the day I was born and it hasn't had a negative affect on me at all. I plan to stay that way until not knowing something that was said or written on the news personally affects me in a negative way.\n\nThe news will always be evil to me. I will never pay it any attention because in my opinion, the news is always negative and preys off of fear and anxiety.\n\n\n\n\n",
