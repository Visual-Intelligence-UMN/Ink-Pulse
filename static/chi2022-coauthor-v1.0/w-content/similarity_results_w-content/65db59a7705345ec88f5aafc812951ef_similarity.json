As if the been read your mind, it again asked \"Your Majesty, waht are your orders?\" The first your think of, prompted by the word 'order', is pizza, of course. \"I will have two slices with extra cheese. No make that four slices so I can share with my little sister\"\n\nThe Bee chuckles, and says \"I meant for you to tell me your orders about the pesticides that are killing us bees. Spare our lives, I beg of you.\"  You smirked, having heard some conspiracy about chemicals that actually prevent food from being killed by insects, being poisonous. That the chemicals and engineered food substances play right into the conspiracy trouble makers. \"Oh Mr. Bee\" you responded, \"you are not going to get killed by the prevention of diseased crops. Stop watching the news!\" \n\nThe Bee flew off, dejected and weary.  You wait patiently for your pizza order with your sister. After what seemed like forever, Mr. Bee was back with the pizza. \"Who will carry out your orders when we are all dead?\" the Bee asked. \n",

Maybe there is something to this so-called conspiracy of the Bees dying. Your sister of all people backed up the Bee's fear, with viable scientific evidence.\n\nYou tell Mr Bee that you will have a plan to save the bees by the end of the week. That is when the Bee can really be valuable. The Bee will carry out your orders to keep the earth friendly and viable for all living beings.\n\n\n",
