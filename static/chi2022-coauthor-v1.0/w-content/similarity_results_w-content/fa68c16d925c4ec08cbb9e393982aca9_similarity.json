        "sentence": "Is Listening to a Book Just as Good as Reading It?\n\nDo you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one and there are even situations where it's more beneficial. I love using audiobooks because I can listen to them while I am laying down before I go to bed. I don't want to read in the dark obviously as that would do damage to my eyes.\n\nI also appreciate audiobooks as they allow people who can't read and people who can't see to be able to \"read\" a book. Audiobooks also give me the option of speeding up the reading. So if I'm a poor reader I can get way more accomplished in a specific time period by listening to the book compared to actually reading it.\n\nI also find it very nice that audiobooks tend to be cheaper than physical books, especially the hardcover ones. We live in a digital world and I am fully invested in that. I will say that I do love holding a book for whatever reason. I like feeling the cover and the pages and also looking at pictures that are sometimes in the middle of the book.\n\nHowever, audiobooks are just more convenient. If I'm on a crowded bus or a crowded train and I have to stand, reading would be very difficult and also uncomfortable. I can put my headphones in and go to an app such as Audible or Chirpbooks and just tune everyone out and get the information from the book that way.\n\nI think there are pros and cons to both methods and also think they are useful in specific scenarios like the one I described above. I just prefer the convenience and the price of audibooks. They fit my needs and wants better when it comes to reading. \n\nI have read physical books and I have listened to many audiobooks. I love both methods and will continue to use both for the rest of my life.  I prefer audiobooks and think that preference will stay for a while. Especially as the audiobook scene continues to grow and improve technology and app wise. \n",
