In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, people are more empathetic to an animal suffering because people feel that animals are like kids in a way. Animals are not really capable of fending for themselves or living on their own the majority of the time. So when an animal is suffering or beaten, it sort of is similar to a little baby being beaten. As far as people being more upset than they are to people, i think we are just desensitized when it comes to human suffering. We see it so often in the news, media, movies, etc. We kind of just feel it is normal, and we know that people are going to do mean things sometimes. I think in a way, if were to be so upset about it each and every time we would drive ourselves crazy mentally. Needless to say, people still do get upset at humans suffering as well, i think the actual news of it though is just a little densensitized. You dont hear about dogs suffering in the newspaper or on the news, but you do with people. I think we as people realize that animals are left out of media sometimes, so when we do hear about their suffering it is almost like it is in a spotlight. Also, people find animals to be much more innocent and adorable in comparison to humans. When you see a cute dog all you want to do is love it and protect it. I think part of this instinct comes from the fact that they cannot really fend for themselves often times, and need someone to help them. Its the same feeling you would get if you saw a infant that was left outside by itself, or if you saw someone harming a little baby. The baby can not protect itself, so your instinct is to go and help it. \n\nI personally dont feel it is wrong to focus on animal suffering, as i feel that if you are focused on helping anyone that is suffering it is a good deed. As far as where to dictate our funds as a country, i think it would be smarter to help people out. Helping people out would be an investment anyway, and this would allow those people who were helped to help out the animals. The more healthy people we have, the more homes we have for these animals. As far as testing products out on animals and what not, i think this is going to happen regardless. Unless we allow experiments on people, animals are simply going to have to take the burden here. The meat industry will probably never go away either. Humans were brought up eating meat, and there would be many deficiencies if we just stopped eating meat all together in my personal opinion. I get some people may be different, however i think that for the large majority of people meat consumption is important. The best thing we can do i would say would be to treat these animals right and give them great lives while they are here. So in conclusion, i dont think it is WRONG to focus on animal welfare, however i feel that human suffering is a larger problem.\n",
