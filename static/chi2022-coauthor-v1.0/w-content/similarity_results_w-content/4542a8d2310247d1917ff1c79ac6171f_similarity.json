You might be able to take advantage of this unlikely opportunity.\n\n\"I want you to go out and find the most beautiful flower you can find, and if you are successful, come back.\"\n\n\"Wilco\" replies the bee, and she flew away.\n\n\"If nothing else,\" you think, I won't have to worry about that bee ever again.  \n\nYou are about to get onto your bike and go home when the bug returns.  \"Right this way, your majesty\"\n\nYou hop onto your bike and follow the bee into the swamp, and you see the most stunning orchid you have ever laid eyes upon.  \n\n\"That's it, that's the one\" you say.  \"Your efforts were satisfactory\".\nYou try to remain calm, but you know that the orchid you have discovered is a rare species that could be worth more than you earn in a year.\n\n\"Actually, answer a question for me\"  you say out loud.  \"Will other bees listen to you?\"\n\n\"We all will, m'lady\" the bee replies.\n\n\"Okay, then, if you want to earn my grudging respect, get your friends together and find more flowers like this one.  Come to think of it, don't lead me or anyone to them, but bring their pollen back to me\"\n\n\"Thy will be done\" the bee replies.  \n\nThe bee flies away, and you get onto your phone and start furiously researching all of your old contacts at the school of botany.  \n\n\"I am the Queen of Bees!\" you say to yourself, as the gears start turning in your head.\n\n\"Long live the queen!\" comes a scattered chorus of tiny voices from in the bushes.\n\n\"Back to work!\" you yell to them.\n\nIt is apparent to you that The Queen of Bees is a very powerful being, with the ability to control any bee in the area, so you don't want to squander it.
