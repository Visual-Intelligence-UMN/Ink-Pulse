He as a tall talented person during College but none of us had any real idea about how famous he'd eventually become.  His family and he struggled these years. It would have been so much better if he could have got a nice endorsement while playing at UCA, my Alma Mater. Even if it would have been fairly modest, it would have meant the world to his family.
