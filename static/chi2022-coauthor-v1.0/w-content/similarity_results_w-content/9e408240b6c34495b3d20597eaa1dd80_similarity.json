What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, Math is by far the most valuable subject to be learned in school. So much so that they teach it from grade school all the way into deep college levels of math. Math is very important because it teaches you the ability to problem solve in different ways. You also learn about numbers and how they work together to form systems that gives you the ability to come up with extremely creative, diverse, and complex ways to solve many issues.\n\nMath is at the core of everything from science, engineering, and business. Math is a universal language, even if two people don't speak the same language dialect. The language of Math is universal on all groups of people in the world. Some even say it could be the universal language if we ever met extraterrestrials as well. Math can help you understand things you never even knew about.\n\nIn my main career of investing and business, I use math everyday to great effect. It helps me and others like me to no end. We could not run a business, or invest wisely without it. A wise investor once said, \"If you don't learn math you're destined to be a loser.\" It has saved me a lot of money in the investing world in the long run, because investing isn't gambling... it's a numbers game. If you have the numbers on your side, you win in the end even in times of drawdown or a rocky market environment. It's not guessing, it's working with the statistics and probabilities.\n\nAnother benefit of math is that it cultivates an important discipline, which is patience, as well as it is like lifting weights for your brain. The more you do it, the stronger and faster you mind will get. Do not underestimate the power of math, because everyone uses it everyday.\n",
