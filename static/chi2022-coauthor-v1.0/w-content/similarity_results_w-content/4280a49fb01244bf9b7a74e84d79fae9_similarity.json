        "sentence": "You were always scared of the outside world. You feared the insects you saw when playing outside. You were in general scared of getting hurt, whether it was from being stung from a bee, or from getting hurt from tripping on the grass. Your parents tried to get you to play outside more with your friends, but struggled to ease your fears. One day, they decided to take you to the park, and let you play with your friends.\n\nAlthough you were happy to see them, you could not ease your fears completely nor calm your nerves. You still tried to play with them, having the occasional fun while playing kick ball with them. As hours pass, your friends and their parents all go home, leaving you with your parents in the park. There were others there, but you did not know them, nor did you want to go near them. Your parents suggest you should play a bit more in the park, before heading on back home. You reluctantly agree, and head back to play in the grass. While playing, you then hear an odd voice that speaks out to you.\n\n\"Hey there, little one,\" the voice calmly states, although you are not sure where it comes from.\n\nYou turn and look around, thinking it was an adult that was speaking to you nearby.\n\n\"I'm right here, little one,\" the voice says, as you see a small, yellow creature with a black face, and wings on its body near your legs. It was a bee, just like the others you were scared of whenever they flew too close to you when playing outside.\n\n\"I'm not going to hurt you, little one,\" the bee says, as it lands on your hand. You ease up a bit, but still feel nervous as it crawls onto your hands.\n\n\"I'm just here to help you,\" the bee says, as it flies up to your face. You start to feel more calm, and realize the bee won't hurt you as you initially feared.\n\n\"I'm here to help you realize your true potential, to help you be more confident when playing outside\" the bee says, as it flies around your head. You wonder how it would be able to do so, asking it out loud how it will do such a thing.  \"I'll help you get over your fears, and help you be more confident by being right beside you whenever you go outside,\" the bee says, as it lands on your shoulder. You then feel more safe as the bee stays on your shoulder, however the voice of your parents soon call you back. You decide to head on back, and see the bee has hidden into your sleeves so your parents wouldn't see it. You head back home with the bee on your body.\n\nThe next day, you head outside to play with your friends again, and the bee is with you. You feel more confident and calm with the bee by your side. You have the most fun with your friends that you ever had in the past. The bee would stick by you for the following month, until one day it disappeared. You were sad that it left, but you knew it was for the best. The bee had given you more confidence like it had promised, and you no longer needed it to go outside without any fear. You silently thank it for its companionship, and hope that it had gone with some else that required its help, and that it would be content in helping another child it need to get over their fears. \n",
