You don't know how you know. but you know \"you\" are dead, that these are all of your past lives, and for some reason you are watching you next life. The \"you\" after you. \n\nYou watch this new life unfold. It's surreal. Well, even more surreal than being dead and being in a room with all of your past selves. Why are you here? Why are you watching this new life? You can't change it, can't help them. You can only watch. \n\nYou look around. You see your past selves, all watching the new life. Some seem more focused than others. You wonder if they are going to be reincarnated again. Wait, where did that though come from. If they were all you, then how could they be someone else too? \n\nYou look back at the screen. The person is grown now in living in a large city; much larger than any you ever lived in. That got you thinking, about the number of people in the world, and how they all must have souls. You wonder if you are the only one in this room. The only soul that is; are you all just one soul with multiple bodies?\n\nThat didn't feel like the right answer. You look around the room again.

A soul gives birth to another, its twin at first, but then growing and changing as all twins do. It was a web of life, and you helped to shape it as well as be shaped by it. \n\nWith that understanding you looked back at the movies and learned. Soon, you too walked through the exit, and though the revelation about souls faded from your mind the feeling of connection, and caring for others as yourself remained. A new life began. \n",
