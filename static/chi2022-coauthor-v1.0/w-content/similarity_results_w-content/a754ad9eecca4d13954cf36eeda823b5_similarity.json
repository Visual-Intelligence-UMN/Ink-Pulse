She has been dating guy after guy but it never seems to work out. Something does seem oddly familiar about the dates she has been going on though. She is unaware that she is actually dating the same guy over and over. It is almost as if the guys are the same in a way. She has been dating a shapeshifter who is trying to get it right this time. However, she does not know this until one fateful night she catches him in the act. She goes into the bathroom and sees him shape-shifting from the guy she has been dating to someone who looks totally different. She is shocked and runs out of the bathroom. She has no idea what to do with the news so she just runs away from his apartment. She goes home and tries to forget about the whole thing. Unfortunately, the shape-shifter already has another scheme cooked up to date her again as a different guy. He is determined to get it right this time. He wants to learn from his failures and not accept that he truly is not the one for her. He is determined to win her over and make her his. After about 2 additional years of this dating back and forth she finally decides to stop dating altogether. She decides to just be single and not date anyone. This is devastating to the shape-shifter and he has no idea what to do. \n",
