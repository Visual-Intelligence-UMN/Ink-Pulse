Just from my perspective, i think what you learn about yourself far exceeds anything you can learn in a class. I think that the teachers are very important, but more for what they can teach you in lifeskills. I think teachers are in a position to be fabulous role models for students. What students should learn in school I feel is what makes them happy, what makes them comfortable, how to achieve goals, etc. There are so many goals you can set in school because of all the resources around you. I learned a ton from playing sports all my life, and this was available to me through school. I gained my work ethic and most of my friends through playing football all my life through college. But in school i found out about the things that were challenging for me, and learned that i could overcome them. I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain. I even learned how to cope with stressful situations and stressful environments. I learned when to stay away from certain people, and I learned how to make friends. I learned that taking risks brings rewards, and I learned that failing is ok and even a good thing. \n\n\n",
