Sue now understood what Kyle's mother went through, as one of the three was a shapeshifter, too.  She had realized that might be the case so she was prepared, but little Ted was definitely more of a handful than his two non-shapeshifting siblings.  But she loved him as much as the others and never regretted marrying Kyle and having his children.\n",
