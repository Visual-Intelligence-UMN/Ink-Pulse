What a dilemma, what should he do? \n\nHe decides to play for time.  He'll take her to the ER, let them run a few tests, bring her home and see how things go.  He didn't find that things went so smoothly though.  The ER doc insisted she be admitted for observation.  He ordered a multitude of expensive and painful tests.  As this went on and on he figured he could never admit to her why she was really in this pickle.  She would hate him.  Their relationship would be over.  \n\nEvery day she got worse.  She couldn't even sleep because of the crazies on the ward screaming all night.  She lost weight.  She looked awful.  She just wasn't the same person anymore.\n\nHe did something he never thought he would do.  He walked away, shifted his shape, and went out on the prowl for a new girlfriend.  This relationship hadn't worked out in the past and certainly wasn't now.  Too bad!\n",
