But as he was dying he wasn't sure if such a thing existed, or if it did, that he would go based on what he had done in life. He lived his life the best he could, but found that he didn't do as much as others to benefit mankind as a whole. With these thoughts racing in his mind, he finally closed his eyes and went into a deep sleep.\n\nSome time later he awoke and found himself in a room with a bunch of people. He was in a hospital, but it was a much different room than the one he was hospitalized for many days. It was a child's room, ornate with toys and drawings on the walls. He realized he was much smaller than before, until realizing that he was no longer in his original body. He was in a small baby's body, and wondered if it was just an elaborate dream he was having. There was no logical explanation for what was happening to him, he couldn't have suddenly been born as someone else.\n\nLance found he was born to a pair of very poor parents who had struggled to make ends meet. He was no longer called Lance by them, but rather Mark. He grew accustomed to that name in time, and felt he was given another chance at life. Mark was appreciative of his new parents, and sympathized with them the struggles they had providing for them. He made sure to focus on his studies, and his parents were more than happy with the grades on his report card. Mark had decided to continue his education and strive for a college degree, something he regretted not getting when he was living as Lance.\n\nIn time he would succeed at getting his degree, which made his parents very proud of him. He got a job as an electrical engineer, and soon moved out of his parent's house. He still kept in touch with them from time to time, and sent them money to help them pay for bills and other expenses. He was happy with how life had turned out for him, and his new parents were very proud of what he had accomplished. Mark decided unlike his past life, he would continue to live life to the fullest. He decided then to start a family, unlike Lance did when he lived his life. \n",
