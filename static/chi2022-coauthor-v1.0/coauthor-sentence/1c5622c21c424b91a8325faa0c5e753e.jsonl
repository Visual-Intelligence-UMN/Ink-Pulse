If not, why not?\n\nHow do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, I think apps like Tinder, speed dating and social media like Twitter and Facebook improve dating and relationships by helping people expand their social, occupational and geographic environments. For instance, with apps like Tinder and online dating, you can explore relationship opportunities in different parts of the world without ever leaving your neighborhood. Shy people can interact with people they would never normally speak to, and introverts can talk to more people than they would ever even consider meeting. Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook connect us to friends, acquaintances and strangers with whom we otherwise would never speak. If I lived in a remote part of Alaska, I would benefit from technology to meet new people and get together with existing friendships. \n\nTechnology also helps a quick match of potential partners. For instance, if you are looking for an ideal marriage partner, online dating sites can help you find someone with complementary interests. Dating apps like Tinder and other technology help you screen potential mates and avoid the “sunk cost” of wasting your time on someone unsuitable. Tinder allows you to “try out” potential partners so when you finally meet, it’s not a complete surprise. On online dating sites, you also have the opportunity to use profile photos, multiple photos and a range of writing styles to help choose a mate. Tinder and other dating apps allow you to quickly evaluate a large number of potential partners in a short period of time. There is no guess work of wondering whether this person is for you.\n\nAs a conclusion, I think apps like Tinder, speed dating and social media like Twitter and Facebook improve dating and relationships.\n",
