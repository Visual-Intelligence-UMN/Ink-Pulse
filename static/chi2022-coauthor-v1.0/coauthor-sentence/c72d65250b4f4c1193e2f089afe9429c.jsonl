I was in a place I didn't know, with people I didn't know. I didn't know what was going to happen to me.\n\nI looked around for someone to ask. I saw a man who looked like me. He had similar clothes, gender, hair, and seemed to be from a more recent era. Many of the people had older clothing, from the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s, but his outfit looked modern. \n\n\"Excuse me,\" I said to him. \"Can you tell me where I am?\" \n\"You're in the cinema,\" he said. \"You died, and now you're watching your next life.\" \n\"But what is this place?\" I said. \"Is it a world-between-worlds?\" \n\"No,\" he said. \"This is the cinema.\"  Finding him very useless, I approached the woman next to him. \n\"Excuse me,\" I said to her.  \"Where am I?\" \n\"You're in the cinema,\" she said. \n\nNobody I asked was able to answer my questions, and indeed, the whole theater stared like zombies at the screen, waiting for the show to begin.  I suddenly noticed a female version of myself, quietly beckoning me over.  She put finger to her lips, and pointed to one of the stage doors, off to the side. Intrigued, I began to head toward her.  Suddenly, I heard a loud gruff voice behind me. \"Stop! Don't let the anomaly escape\" \n\n",
