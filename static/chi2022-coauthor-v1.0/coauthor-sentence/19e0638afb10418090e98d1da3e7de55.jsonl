I think that the most important thing I have learned in school is how to learn, even though I didn't really know it at the time, and this skill has stayed with me throughout my life.  If I had applied myself more strongly in school, I would probably be doing much better.\n\nThere is a common argument than in the internet age, people don't really need to learn facts, because we can easily find the answers to questions.  However, I think this idea is misguided.  School is necessary to teach students a foundation of knowledge, so that they can know what questions they need to be asking.  For this reason, knowing basic mathematics, and also the fundamentals of grammar, history, the scientific method, and the humanities are vitally important for everyone.  \n\nSomeone can easily find out what year the Battle of Hastings took place, but without attending school and paying sufficient attention, they wouldn't know that such a thing was important, nor would they have any idea why it was a topic of discussion.  I think that by learning how to learn, I can continue to expand my own breadth of knowledge, and to deal with unexpected new problems, simply because I recognize facts and techniques that I had used before.  Obviously, no one can remember everything, but a good education can remind us of what we need to know, and thus, make it easy to figure it out again.  \n\nHowever, I also think that there are some very important subjects that are not being taught in school, and I wish that I had learned these things when I was young.  \n\n\n",

Kids (and adults) need to learn how to evaluate claims that are made by pundits, by journalists, and by advertisers.  Many of the current problems our country faces would be alleviated if people had simply gained the ability to recognize when they are being lied to.  \n\nAnother important topic that should be taught in school is personal finance, accounting, and law.  Students leave school without enough practical knowledge, and oftentimes, their parents lack this knowledge as well.  As I said before, a child with a good fundamental education can teach him or herself how to deal with practical problems in life, but it would be much easier if they were taught this kind of thing in school.  If I had my way, \"Home Economics\" would be brought back and taught every year, and it would teach students about all the practical issues they will face at home, including economics, maintenance, car repair, budgeting, and so on.  \n\nAlas, I am starting to get off topic, so I will return to my main point.  The most important thing you can learn in school is how to learn.  If you know the basics of the research process, and also know enough basic facts to recognize how complicated most problems are, you can probably figure out the rest for yourself.  I think it took me well into my college years to be able to say that I finally understood these things, and sadly, many students will not have that same opportunity.  And that is why I think that schools should concentrate on fundamentals, but also on pragmatics.  \n\nI hope that future generations will be taught how to teach themselves to deal with unique problems, but I also hope that they will be taught exactly how to deal with the most common problems.\n",
