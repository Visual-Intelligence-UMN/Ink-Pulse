They are often portrayed as being very smart, but also very socially awkward and shy. Being very smart in America is not looked kindly upon by a large minority of our population. So that too can be a damaging stereotype. I have known a variety of Asian people and some are smart, shy or awkward but most are just somewhere in between like the rest of us. Other then slight differences in facial features, they are just like every other human on earth. They fall along a spectrum of different social and personal types. \n",

These two stereotypes are also very unfair. The few Asian women I have gotten to know have been a mix of these traits and many more. People are much to complex to reduce them to a few simple stereotypes. Not just Asian people but all people. It has just been the Asian people in American media that has put a bad taste in my mouth over the years and I think its time we address it. \n",
