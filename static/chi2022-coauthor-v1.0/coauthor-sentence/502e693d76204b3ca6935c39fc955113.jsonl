        "text": "Is It Selfish to Pursue Risky Sports Like Extreme Mountain Climbing?\n\nSome sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, I think dangerous sports are bad.   People need to realize that everything has a limit. To combine competition and danger is irresponsible. You shouldn't risk your life for the sake of winning. Also, by striving to win, you are encouraging your competitors to risk their lives in order to outperform you. This is not right. This is not sport. I am against competition with risk of injury and death involved. It goes against my beliefs of what sport should be. Furthermore, when winning relies on a risk of injury or death, then it is not even a \"game\" anymore. A true game should be fun and end with a handshake. It is a mutual benefit to both competitors.  I am also against extreme sport athletes getting paid to act irresponsibly. There are people that live careful safe lives and are not rewarded for it.  It sets a bad example.   When someone does something dangerous and gets rewarded for it, imitated behavior will increase. Kids might see athletes doing dangerous things and think it is okay because they saw an athlete do it. There needs to be a limit\n",
