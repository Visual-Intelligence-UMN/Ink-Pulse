He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. \n\nArthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf \"wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm down from this. \n",

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.\n\nThe 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, \"dude.\" \n\nThe 92nd little pig said, \"you can't come in,\" and the wolf was like, \"I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!\" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, \"what are you laughing about?\" \n\nAnd Arthur said, \"because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material. I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!\" \n\nAnd the wolf was like, \"I don't get it. Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?\" \n\nAnd Arthur said, \"because it is the strongest material there is. I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!\" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. \n\nBut when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch. The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. \n\nArthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf \"wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?\" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!\n\nSo now the 93rd little pig needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to stay there because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought.\n",

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs.

And the wolf was like, \"dude.\" \n\nThe 92nd little pig said, \"you can't come in,\" and the wolf was like, \"I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!\" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, \"what are you laughing about?\" \n\nAnd Arthur said, \"because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material. I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!\" \n\nAnd the wolf was like, \"I don't get it. Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?\" \n\nAnd Arthur said, \"because it is the strongest material there is. I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!\" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. \n\nBut when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch. The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. \n\nArthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf \"wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?\" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!\n\nSo now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. \n\nThe 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart. Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily.\n",

The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. \n\nArthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf \"wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?\" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!\n\nSo now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. \n\nThe 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart. Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily. He coated it so heavily that it looked like an old Victorian house with gingerbread, but more industrial. He looked back to admire his work. The lead paint made his house similarly indestructible as Arthur's house had been, but there would be no risk that this house would blow up with a nuclear grenade. Matty invited his brother Arthur to stay with him in the new house. He needed a roommate. \n\nMatty and Arthur enjoyed living together in the new house. It had the hallmarks of a good house: it was well-maintained, it was centrally located, and it came with a roommate. They enjoyed it so much, in fact, that they invited their sister Molly to live with them. And that is the story of how the 92nd little pig, 93rd little pig, and 94th little pig came to find a new home.\n",
