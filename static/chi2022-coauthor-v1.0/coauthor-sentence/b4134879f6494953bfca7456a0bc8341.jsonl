        "text": "When you die, you appear in a cinema with a number of other people who look like you. You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching yourself on the big screen. The film that you are watching is your next life, and you can enter into your own body when the movie starts. You do this for a moment when you are 2 years old, and are responsible for your next self's first words. Then you leave, and watch the rest of your childhood on the screen. It proceeds well, better than you'd remembered your past one going, apparently learning to talk a bit earlier  gave you an advantage, and you do very well in school. You pop in for a moment when you're 5 to teach yourself some math, and as it turns out, you get through elementary school with straight A's in all of your subjects.\n\nAt this point you get a sudden thought, and look at the other versions of yourself in the theater. Are they getting involved in the progress of your life, too? You put the thought aside and go back to watching the film.\n\nWhen you are in 7th grade, and just starting puberty, you visit yourself again. You decide to give yourself another little assist, and with a bit of guidance, and adult confidence, you have your first girlfriend and lose your virginity before you're 13.  This gives your popularity a real shot in the arm, and you enter high school not just a star student, but popular with the ladies, too. You take another glimpse at the version of yourself sitting next to you, and he gives you a smirk. You pause for a second, then resume watching the move.\n\nIt's when you go to college that things start to get sour.   You try to help yourself out with a little advice, but you see that your college self is getting involved in some bad things. Despite your efforts to get things back on track, and your visits where you keep yourself on the straight and narrow, buckle down, and try to study, your future you has gotten involved with drugs, and his grades have suffered. You watch, horrified, as your future self drops out of college and starts a downward spiral. \n\nYou enter the film again, and again, and try to help your future you, but none of your efforts seems to produce a lasting result. You look at the version of yourself sitting next to you, and he's grinning broadly, and you're sure he's sabotaging your efforts deliberately.\n\nYou turn to him and ask him why he's doing this.   \"Why are you trying to sabotage my efforts?\" He looks at you for a moment, then answers. \"Why do you think?\" You're silent. He speaks again.  \"Don't you remember what happened before?' You remain silent, and think.\n\nHe inches closer to you, the look on his face one of bitter triumph. \"Things never worked out  the way you wanted them too, because you were always your own worst enemy.' \n\nHe moves in close and places his hand on your knee.\n",
