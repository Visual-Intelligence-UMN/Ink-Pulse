When they're on the date the woman realizes that this man is perfect for her. Everything is going well, they are getting along and laughing and there is a charm in the air.\n\nThe woman is so happy that she decides to go on a second date. The second date however doesn't go as well. A drunk man comes up to their table and tries to hit on the woman. The man ends up getting in a fight and knocks the man out. This upsets the woman because there was no need for it. She can stand up for herself. \n\nThe man apologizes to the woman but tells her he would do it again and that nobody hits on his woman. The woman is appalled and breaks things off with the man.\n\nThe man ends up chasing her in different disguises as he is a shapeshifter and finally gets her when she is vulnerable again. He shows up as a similarly handsome man but with blonde hair, facial hair and even more muscles this time.\n\nThey go on a date and everything is going well. They go on a second date and everything is going well. They go on a third date and the man gets on one knee and proposes to her. The woman is shocked because they had only been dating a month. She thinks back to her previous relationships and how they felt. She knew this one was special but one month felt so short to make a life long commitment to someone.\n\nHowever, the woman didn't care and took a risk. She agreed to get married to the man. They had a wedding date set and that day was fast approaching. The wedding plans were going smoothly, the woman was excited as was the man.\n\nOn their wedding day however, something terrible would happen. The man was getting ready to say his vows. He was extremely nervous. So nervous that on accident he revealed his true self instead of the faux muscular, handsome man that he was. The man ended up being an obese man that was balding. The woman was shocked. She knew that she shouldn't commit so quickly but she felt something special.\n\nThe bride ran outside of the venue and all the way home. She was crying when the man walked in and explained to her how sorry he was. The bride didn't care and demanded that he leave. She ended up moving to California and never seeing the man again. The long-term issues were horrible as she had PTSD and trust issues.\n\nA man had taken advantage of her mind when she was vulnerable. He ruined her wedding day. He ruined the most important day of her life in front of all of her friends and family. It was a cruel stunt by the man.\n\nLuckily, 10 years later the woman finally got back on the dating scene and found the man of her dreams. She ended up marrying him and they had 3 kids, 1 of which ended up being a professional basketball player. The woman was happy and was one of the best moms of all time. Her struggle was real, but she was able to overcome it and see the other side. She finally was at peace and was happy. \n",
