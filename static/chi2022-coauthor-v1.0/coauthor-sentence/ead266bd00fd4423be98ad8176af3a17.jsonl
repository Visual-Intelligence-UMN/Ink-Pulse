        "text": "All of the \"#1 Dad\" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly. At first people don't know what the numbers mean - they all just look like random numbers after all. But soon enough people start to figure it out. It wasn't that hard actually; kids talk, parents talk, neighbors talk. And everyone know who the really good dads are, and the really bad ones. \n\nSo there were a lot of very uncomfortable conversations, and most dads stopped admitted they even had the mugs. But the mugs were still there, and the numbers were still there. Even after mugs were broken or thrown away. They always seemed to come back, usually with a lower number on them. \n\nThe mugs were a problem. So what does the world do when there is a problem?

And new parenting handbooks appeared in every household, along with a list of consequences if they were not adhered to. \n\nEventually humans got used to being under the control of the aliens. Maybe it wasn't a perfect solution, but the world did seem like a calmer, quieter place. The mugs eventually returned. And from then on they all said #1 Dad. Or else.\n",
