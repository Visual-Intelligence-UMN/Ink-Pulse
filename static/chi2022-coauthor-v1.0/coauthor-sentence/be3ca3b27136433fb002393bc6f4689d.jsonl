Students who are lucky enough to be a part of the team can receive just about anything they ask for off the field and still receive free tuition, room, board, and the opportunity to be on a university team. If a player gets injured, that player is also provided with insurance, along with a stipend for their education. \n\nIf this same system were implemented in the United States, many colleges would be able to provide the same service the University of Tennessee implements. Not only does paying college athletes create a more stable future for student-athletes, but it also creates a more fair society where those who make the most money for their schools, get the most amount of money back from their schools. \n\nCollege sports can also be seen as a leveler, where kids who couldn't afford to play for professional teams would have an opportunity to play for prestigious college teams. If college athletes were paid, it could lead to all kinds of new talent for universities and professional sports teams, which would be very difficult to ignore.\n",

The universities benefit from their players in promos, ticket sales, and other perks that allow the school to generate positive funds. Students who are lucky enough to be a part of the team can receive just about anything they ask for off the field and still receive free tuition, room, board, and the opportunity to be on a university team. If a player gets injured, that player is also provided with insurance, along with a stipend for their education.  \n\nAdditionally, athletes can gain endorsement money, and do advertising for companies. They can capitalize on the popularity of their images, and their place on the school's team. There is widespread satisfaction for this program by all players.\n\nIf this same system were allowed in the United States, many colleges would be able to provide the same service that the Australia implements.

It's time we overhauled the system and followed the lead of other countries in college sports!\n\n\n",
