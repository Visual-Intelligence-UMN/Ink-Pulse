Sometimes they come on suddenly and there is no time to get to a store. Sometimes you can bum a pad or tampon off someone else, but what is someone supposed to do if they aren't? There need to be materials available to them for FREE in case of emergencies like this. Nobody should have to walk around staining their clothes because they don't have a pad or tampon.\n\nViagra is free. Condoms are free. Things that identified men use but identified women have to suffer? Lmao okay. That doesn't make sense. If part of this stuff is free, it should ALL be free.\n\nPeople would be inclined to go to school if they knew there was a place that was safe. A bathroom stocked with pads and tampons would help with this - yes, the nurse may have stuff, but some people are too embarrassed to talk about their issues with someone, even if it's between two women.\n",
