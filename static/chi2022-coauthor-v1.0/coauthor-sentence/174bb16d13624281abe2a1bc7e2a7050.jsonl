It reads \"I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job.\" Signed simply, \"JFK.\"\n\nYou are really confused about this letter, and still groggy from your sleep, you question who could have been signing their name as JFK. Even more so you wonder how they got into your room while you where sleeping. You decide to call the number and you are greeted by a voice that sounds like it belongs to a young man. You ask who it is, and they introduce themselves as William. You see one of your secret service people standing outside your room. You ask William to hold on a second, and they agree.\n\nYou ask your secret service member if they saw anything in the night, anything strange. They tell you no. So you return to the call with William. He tells you that you need to get to the airport immediately. You agree, but also ask how they got the letter into your room while you were sleeping, and how they got past the guards.
