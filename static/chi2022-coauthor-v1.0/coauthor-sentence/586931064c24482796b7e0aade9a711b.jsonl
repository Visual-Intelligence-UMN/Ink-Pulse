I would rather see a character that is more of an original. One that has some depth to them. You typically don't see that with stereotypical characters because the stereotype is their personality. \n\nStereotypes in movies and film just annoy me to be honest. They turn me off. When I'm watching a movie or a television show I don't want to see characters and dialogue similar to things I have seen for decades. I want new, I want fresh and I want complex personalities.\n\nThe best characters are the ones that stand out and are unique. Stereotypes aren't unique. They're tired and boring. I've had enough of them in movies and TV. They're overdone. \n\nA world where stereotypes are done with is a world that I want to live in. They're offensive and wrong. \n",
