When the FBI called the alien, he was very happy they told him they would give him the car. The alien met up with the FBI a day later. He brought Mr. Damon and the FBI had the car. The FBI agent and the alien shook hands and right as they did that, Matt Damon got free and ran to the Ferrari. He started it up and drove away, stealing the car. So in the end the alien didn't get his ransom and Matt Damon got himself a new sports car and lived happily ever after. \n",
