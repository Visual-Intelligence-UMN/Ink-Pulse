As the immortals live their lives on the island they discover new ways to become self sufficient and do not need to depend on the government very much anymore. As time went buy they built their own water system and electricity grid. Years have passed since the government put them there and it is now 50 years later and they have totally become independent from the government. They are living in peace and a happy  , healthy live away from the infected and have no plans of returning to the mainland or asking for help from the government ever again. \n",
