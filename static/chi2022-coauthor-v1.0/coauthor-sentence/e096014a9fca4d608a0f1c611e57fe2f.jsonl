The shapeshifter acknowledged her desire, having no interest in ever harming her, or letting any harm befall her. \n\nAnd so they hit it off, going date after date. He got to know her more personally, but she would truly never get to know the real him. For as a shapeshifter, he could never tell her the truth about who he was. Perhaps that was the real reason she would break up with them in the future, despite her insistence that she was not ready for a relationship. \n\nSo the shapeshifter tried again soon after, with a new form and a new identity. However, no matter what they tried, it seemed the outcome with the artist remained the same. She would always say that she was not ready for a relationship, and that she wanted to focus on her art. The shapeshifter found themselves rejected over and over again by the same woman, despite trying different forms each time. \n\nThe shapeshifter was at a loss, and didn't know what else to do. They felt desolate, and empty, no longer filled with the same drive as they felt the moment they first laid eyes on the woman. Perhaps, they thought, it was simply not meant to be. They would continue to date other people, but they would never feel the same way about anyone else as they did about the artist. They eventually stopped trying to date others, and focused on themself. They even decided to take on a more permanent form, to truly discover who they really are. They made friends, ones that truly felt close and personal, and people they could rely on. For a while, they truly felt happy. One day, they went out for drinks with their friends to a new bar. \n",

She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time. It all started one fateful evening, for the shapeshifter. For them, it was no problem getting a date. For whatever person they encountered, it was a matter of turning into their heart's desire, their heartthrob, or dream date. They could be anyone, and it was easy to get a date. However, the shapeshifter desired more, they wanted something long term. No matter who they dated, they never seemed to personally connect with their date. That was, until they met a special woman, sitting by herself at the bar. The shapeshifter was instantly smitten, and decided to make a move.
