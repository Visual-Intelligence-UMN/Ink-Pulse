If not, why not?\n\nHow do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. \n\nSoeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call. Isn't that what Tinder is all about? I had no idea this crazy girl was so emotionally involved with me after only one night. Even though she was a decent lay, I care a lot about quality over quantity, so I decided to have nothing more to do with her.\n",
