Their mission: to locate the fabled Keystones, and rebuild the link between mankind and its magic.\n\nIf the Keystones are found, humanity will be restored again.  The new generation of humans have advanced technology that can help them find the keystones. Think about a device like a GPS but the device can find any item in the world.  The humans have to travel across the world in order to get these Keystones.\n\nThere are 4 of them total and they are found in different areas. The first 3 keystones are found fairly quick but they're having issues with the 4th one. The device is pointing them in one direction but there is nothing to be found. \n\nThey end up changing the devices batteries and funnily enough the direction changes. The 4th Keystone is to the East. They end up getting the 4th Keystone.\n\nAll 4 Keystones have to be combined in order to drain the aliens of their power. This will also restore all previous humans and restore mankind in general. \n\nThe new generation of humans combines the 4 Keystones and all of a sudden there is a spark seen in the sky. Almost a lightning bolt if you will. Slowly but surely all humans get restored.\n\nWe see the entire world go back to the way that it was previously. Mankind is back. Humans are rejoicing. The world has been saved and the mission has been completed.\n",
