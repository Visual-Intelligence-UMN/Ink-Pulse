I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to \"switch off\" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention.

On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.\n\nReading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. \n\nI've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners? \n\nIn conclusion, I am happy to stick to reading real books. I think that there's a lot to be said for the real, tangible relationship between a reader and their pages. Plus, there's definitely a lot to be said for \n",
