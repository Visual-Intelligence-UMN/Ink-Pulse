When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. The first sign of the exciting new power is the ability to slow time down for about 6 seconds. This can be useful in many situations. For example, one man was about to crash his car into a tree but was able to slow time down just as a result of his panic This allowed him to open the door, roll out of the car, and land softly in some bushes while his car exploded into a million pieces, none of which was a part of himself. One unfortunate thing: his passenger was not so lucky.\n",
