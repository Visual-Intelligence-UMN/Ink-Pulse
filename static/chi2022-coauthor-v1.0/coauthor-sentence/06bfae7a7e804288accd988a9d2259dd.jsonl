How we got to where we are is the public educations systems fault, big techs fault and our unwillingness to challenge our own beliefs. If we were better informed and had common, objective truths that held us together we would be much better off. \nSo in conclusion, it is not just important to keep up with current events, its important to view them objectively using the best evidence and not jumping to conclusions. While not engaging in current affairs does not necessary make you a bad citizen but it does take away from the much needed participation in a democracy.\n",
