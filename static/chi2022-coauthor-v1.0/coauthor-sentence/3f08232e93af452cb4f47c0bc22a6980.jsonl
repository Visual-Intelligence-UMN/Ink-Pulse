It should definitely not be shameful to talk about as many women are experiencing it and it is a normal part of life.

Even if a student is free to be discrete or open about their period, one thing's for sure: they should not be ashamed of it. If a student had a period accident, it shouldn't be a big deal. Students should be able to talk about it freely without being shamed and probably the most important of all, is how teachers should have the capability and the authority to help a student that needs help with her period.\n\nAnd lastly, freedom of choice should be given to our students. It doesn't matter whether a student wants to use a tampon or a pad, they should be given the freedom to choose what they want to use.
