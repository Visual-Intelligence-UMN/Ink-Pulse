Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.\n\nWhy do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, it's not wrong. I think people tend to defend what speaks to their heart, or what they have a connection with. I know that I don't have a connection to humans who are suffering, but I have a connection to animals. I am empathetic to human suffering, but animals are more defenseless and less able to speak for themselves. It really comes down to choice- what do I choose to focus my feelings and efforts on.   And it's not always easy to let go of one advocacy to focus on another. We all have unique interests, viewpoints, and strengths and weaknesses. Some people are very involved in animal rights and not involved in politics. Some people are very involved in politics and not involved in animal rights. Some people are not involved in either. The point is , we all pick our battles for a reason. As long as we are fighting the good fight- keeping animals out of harm's way, and helping them live better lives, then we are doing a good thing.   For animals AND humans.   By fighting for animals, we are fighting for a better world for everyone.\n",
