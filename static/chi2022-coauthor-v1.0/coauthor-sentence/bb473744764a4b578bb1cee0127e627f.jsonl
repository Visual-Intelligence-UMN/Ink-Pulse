I think we will continue to use our screens just as much until a new technology comes along that replaces them and I think after this it will just be the norm for everyone to be on their devices a majority of the time they are awake. We will continue to study the effects but in the short and mid term, screens are here to stay and they have increased productivity and saved lives during this pandemic and has just made it easier on all of us. So there is no doubt in my mind that we need to embrace them as much as possible now and sort things out after the pandemic. \n",
