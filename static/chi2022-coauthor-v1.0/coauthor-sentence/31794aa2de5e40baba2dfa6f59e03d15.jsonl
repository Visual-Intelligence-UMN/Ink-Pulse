        "text": "\nOne day you awake to find yourself in a mysterious room, that isn't like your typical bedroom. In fact, the room is better furnished and seems much more expensive than the items you own. The massive flat screen in front of you is new, and you wonder how much it could have cost, much less how you could ever afford it on your personal income. Turning to your right you see a bathroom, and you get out of bed to examine this luxurious bathroom. The bathroom, like the bedroom is much more elegant than your utilitarian restroom, having a much more massive shower with its own tub. You glance at the mirror to inspect yourself, and you are shocked at what you see.\n\nStaring in front of the mirror is none other than famous actor Matt Damon. Confused by this, you begin to think that maybe this is a dream. There is no logical way you could be Matt Damon, or even controlling his body. You were just an average person, who had an average life with an average job at the local hospital, not some renowned actor that earns millions per movie. \n\nSuddenly the door to your bathroom opens, and you are met by none other than your wife, Luciana. She wonders what is going on, as you normally do not spend so much time in the rest room inspecting yourself. You try to explain what has happened and how you have become Matt Damon, but she just looks at you crazily and does not believe you. She otherwise passes it off as an elaborate joke you are making, and suggests that you get ready to go to work.\n\nWork, you ponder, it surely meant a film shoot, and not your usual job at the hospital. Your mind was racing trying to piece together this new reality you were thrust into, and you couldn't help but think that your were way over your head. Grabbing Matt Damon's smart phone, you noticed a missed call, who left a voicemail. The message was from your agent, Alex saying to get to the film shoot in about an hour as you are needed for an important shot. You then panic, as you get the address to the film set, and you head out. You drive in a car that you don't recognize, and get to the set on time.\n\nThere everyone seems relived to see you arrive, and they thrust you onto the set. You are told that your need to act for this film is very important, and the production company cannot stall any longer. You are then given little time to rehearse, and filming begins almost immediately. The performance you give feels mediocre to you, but the director and the rest of the crew find it satisfactory. The assure you that they will edit it to be much more engaging before it releases in films. You leave the set, and spend the rest of your day at Matt Damon's home.\n\nThe next day you wake up, and walk into the bathroom to take a shower. You realize you are back in your old body, and that you are no longer Matt Damon. Relieved, you realized that it was all an elaborate, but interesting dream you had. That is until you ended up watching the latest Matt Damon film that you were in, and noticed the scene you acted in. Seeing the way Matt Damon moved their hands during the scene made you realize it was you controlling his body during that shoot, and that it wasn't a dream you had. For one day in your life, you were Matt Damon, and the thought of such filled you with such as sense of pride even if no one else would ever believe you.\n",
