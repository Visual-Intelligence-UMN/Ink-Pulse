A benefit of texting is that it can be a relatively convenient way of communicating with a current or potential partner because it's not as immediate as talking on the phone or in person. But a pitfall of this, is that it can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, and can also be a way of avoiding talking to your partner in person. So, texting can either be a good or bad thing, depending on how it's used, and the specific circumstances of the relationship.\n\nPersonally, I haven't found dating apps, Netflix, or texting to be of much use in dating, but many of my friends and acquaintences have found them to be useful.\n",
