        "text": "Humans once wielded formidable magical power. But with over 7 billion of us on the planet now, Mana has spread far too thinly to have any effect. When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. As the numbers of humanity dwindle from alien bombardment, the creatures of magic, buoyed by the increase in free-floating Mana, begin to re-emerge.  The first to awaken are the elves, who have spent the last few centuries in a magical sleep. Their charms and arrows prove to be surprisingly effective against alien armor, and beam weapons. The next to stir are the dwarves, who have long been in hiding, and have been preparing for this day. Dwarven siege engines and other primitive devices of destruction are even more effective against the aliens, and a dwarf trebuchet manages to, for the first time, bring down an alien ship.\n\nAfter that, the goblins and other darker magical creatures begin to stir. Though long enemies of both man, and the other magical beings, they join forces with the other survivors to fight the alien menace, and their poison darts wreak havoc among the ranks of the alien troops. Finally, the dragons, the oldest of all magical creatures, awaken from their slumber. Their fiery breath and claws are devastating against the aliens, and their armored scales are proof against their weapons. The mere presence of the creatures often makes the most battle-hardened alien warriors flee in terror. Meanwhile, the humans begin to discover their own latent magical abilities. Now human mages can join in the battle, and their spells are the final ingredient that helps turn the tide of the war.\n\nWithin a few years, the aliens are defeated, and the survivors are able to begin rebuilding their civilization. But now, humanity is no longer sole master of the planet. The magical creatures have returned, and they are not willing to give up their new-found freedom.\n",
