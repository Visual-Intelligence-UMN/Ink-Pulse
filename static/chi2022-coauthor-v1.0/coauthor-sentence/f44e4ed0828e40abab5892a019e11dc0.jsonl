Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\" You're confused.  You don't know what to do. Did a bee just talk to me? More importantly, will I be stung? You're frozen in bewilderment and fear.\n\nThe bee speaks again. \"Your Majesty, the hive is in danger. The Queen has been captured by a group of humans. We need you to lead us to her.\" This all seems very strange, but for some reason, you don't question it. \"All right..\" you say. \"Let's go.\"  The bee flies off your shoulder and buzzes towards the window, pausing for a moment to look back at you over its shoulder, or whatever bees have in place of shoulders. You raise your arms.  You find that they have transformed into a pair of large, membranous wings. You look at your body, and see that you has become a large, fuzzy bee. The bee darts out the window, and you chase after it.\n\nYou fly over the treetops, and see a group of men in a clearing, surrounding a large, wooden box. You don't see any way that just you two can overpower these men. \"What should we do?\" you ask the bee. \"We need to get more bees.\" it responds. \"How do we do that?\" you ask. \"Just call to them. As their Princess, they will follow you.\" You begin to buzz, and before long , a large swarm of bees has gathered. You hesitate for an instant, then you lead them towards the clearing. You, and your swarm, descend on the men, stinging them and chasing them away. Many workers die as they lose their stingers, but as a young Queen, you are able to sting repeatedly, and your stings are decisive.\n\nYou order your bees to open the box, and they do so. You catch a glimpse of the Queen, and you see that she is weak and covered in wounds.\n",
