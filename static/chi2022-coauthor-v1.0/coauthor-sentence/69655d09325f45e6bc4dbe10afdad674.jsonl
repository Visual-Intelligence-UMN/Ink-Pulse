I'd suggest that the answer is, they don't really care about animals at all, they just want to feel good about themselves. So the question here about animal versus human welfare is a false one. The real question is, why\n",

Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.\n\nWhy do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, it is ridiculous to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. I'll go one step further, and say that it is absurd, and possibly immoral, to focus on animal welfare at all. Humans are the smartest, and most complex, beings on the planet. They are far more capable than other animals of feeling pain, and of suffering. Furthermore, humans are our own species, and we should be focusing on our own welfare, primarily relating to ourselves and those closest to us, but also to our fellow humans in general. A person who doesn't have the time, or inclination, to aid other humans might be justified if all of their efforts are going towards helping themselves.  In fact, a person might also be justified in feeling that they don't have an obligation to help other humans, and that their duty to help is owed only to themselves and their families and friends.\n\nA person who devotes efforts to helping animals though, isn't in either of these positions.  What can their possible justification be? They're expending effort to help animals, they can't be too resource-strapped or busy, and if they aren't, they should be helping other humans before animals, yet they aren't, and I can't think of any good reason why they shouldn't be. They're being actively immoral by not helping humans, and actively immoral by helping animals. In short, they're a bad person.\n\nI could spend a lot of time showing other reasons why a concern for animals is absurd. For starters, animals don't have rights. like humans. They aren't protected by the law, like humans. They are routinely used as sources of food, and clothing, and entertainment, and for scientific experimentation. This isn't confined to humans, either, animals do this themselves to other species to the extent that they're able. Animals don't care about the suffering of other animals, and they don't care about the suffering of humans. So animals are just doing what they should be doing, it's a few strange, overly sentimental humans that are violating the natural order of things.\n\nI guess the question becomes, why do these people care so much about animals, in such oddly specific situations, when they don't care about other humans, or even other animal species in general? I'd suggest that the answer is, they don't really care about animals at all, they just want to feel good about themselves. So the question here about animal versus human welfare is a false one.
