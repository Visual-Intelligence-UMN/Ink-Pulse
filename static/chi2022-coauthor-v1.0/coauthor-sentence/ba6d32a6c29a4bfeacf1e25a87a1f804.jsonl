I dont want to be the father that takes his kid to a ballgame once in a while and calls it good. I want to be the father that the kids look up to from the time they are young, until the time they are old. Not because they are nice, or fun, or cool. But simply because they are real, and they care about the kids no matter what. As this thought popped into my head another letter was drawn on the cup. Now the cup read JO, and the R was being written and erased over and over. It was like some sort of puzzle or something. It was crazy though because it was my thoughts that filled in the next letter. I wondered what the point of finishing the name on the mug was, and if it was something that had to be done. Maybe this was some sort of therapy to me. I tried to remember what i was doing last when i fell into this dream like mode. Was I stressed, happy, anxious? Why am i deliberating how good of a dad I am? Just like that i woke up again, but this time really woke up. I asked my buddy where i was. He told me that i had taken some shrooms and was most likely hallucinating or in a trans.... Wow.",
