Despite this, in the cold light of day, we should be more concerned for our fellow humans, of any persuasion, than any animals.  Humans have much more capacity to anticipate pain, to fear the future, and suffer emotionally, in both the short and long term.  If we don't show concerns for other or species is in trouble and faces an uncertain future.  For sure, we should be concerned at the treatment of animals, but not at the expense of humans.  If we ourselves want to be treated humanely by others, we have to treat them the same.  This is at the very root of a civil society.  So, in conclusion,  if other human need our help we should never use our energies to aide animals instead.\n",
