Lacking a basic confidence in one's ability and or trust in others increases doubt, and can ultimately cause a decrease in performance. Throughout life, there will no doubt be unexpected situations or stressful periods of time that ultimately challenges a person. Learning how to handle these situations is crucial to ones success in school as well as later on in life. I know that believing in myself and others will help in my career and or other opportunities I experience in my life. Trust is critical in group situations, which I face a good portion at work. Without trust, cohesion is affected and you are forced to work individually when many tasks require the work efforts and skill set of others. For those reasons and more, I believe students benefit from a school experience as it helps them work well with others, to build self-confidence and their self-esteem along with the ability to confine in colleagues, friends, and other people they will encounter in life.\n",
