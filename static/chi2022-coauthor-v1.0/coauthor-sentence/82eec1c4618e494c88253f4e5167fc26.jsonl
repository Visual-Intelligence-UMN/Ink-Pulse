        "text": "Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations\" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.\n\nSpending your life growing old while your younger siblings, friends and family all stay the same age is unbelievably depressing. It's a lonely, meaningless existence. You're gawked at and stared, whispered over and laughed about. But, as you get older you start to see something strange happening. \n\nYou are having regular health issues, despite making an effort to look after yourself. You're thinning hair, your skin is sagging and wrinkles are beginning to appear. And inside? Your arteries are clogging and your joints are aching. \n\nAfter a fall on the stairs you have a visit to your doctor. As you sit in the waiting room you notice something strange is happening to the other patients. They have simple problems, a papercut, a stubbed toe, a skinned knee. But their pain is unmanageable. They are passing out while sitting there, unable to handle the severity of the pain. \n\nYour doctor tells you that it's something they've been seeing more and more, but that it's nothing to worry about. To take care of yourself and you'll be fine. But you aren't worried about yourself now. As you drive home, you pass a park and what you see makes you slam on the brakes. \n\nA young, healthy man is limping down the street with what appears to be a shattered leg. You pull over and stare. He's screaming in pain and his leg is dragging behind him. As you start to exit the car to help, the man falls to the ground with a last scream and suddenly a thick black smoke emanates from his leg, rushing up his body, fire covering every inch of him until mere seconds later, he is a pile of dust. \n\n\"They are supposed to be immortal,\" you think to yourself. But you see them dying all around you. That is when you realize that as you've aged, your body has had time to transition and reflect on it's pain. The immortals... only the pure survive. Only the undamaged. This isn't immortality, this side effect is creating a new  natural selection.\n\nAnd for the first time in your 85 years, you are glad you were not chosen.",
