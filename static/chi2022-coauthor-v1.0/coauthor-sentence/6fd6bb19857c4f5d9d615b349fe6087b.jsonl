Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.\n\nTwo weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.\n\nWhen he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives. Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. \n\nCarol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe. She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed. They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first. \n\n\"But where is the real Carol, does she know about this?\" Bruce asked. \n\nThe executives all had unsettling grins, but didn't answer. One locked the door as another closed the blinds, and a third, brought out a stack of paperwork and a video camera. Carol's eyes lit up and she smiled, revealing rows of perfect white teeth.It was then that Bruce knew what was going on.\n",

That was the premise of the new TV show Bruce was trying to pitch to the higher ups. \n\nAfter hearing Bruce's pitch, the executives all agreed that his show sounded just like all of those other shows about families and relationships. He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him. \n\nHe went home that night and was a bit worried. That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship.
