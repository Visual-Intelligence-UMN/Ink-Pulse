For youth to be able to interact with diverse people in a situation where you have to help each other to survive, can't really be taught in life outside a gaming situation. \n\n\n",

As with anything in this life, moderation and discipline are key. This actually another benefit.

The advantages are obvious to me and technology should be embraced and utilized as the tool it is.\n",
