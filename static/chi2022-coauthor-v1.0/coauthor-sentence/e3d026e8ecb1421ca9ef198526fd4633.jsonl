The male ego is a very fragile thing. \n\nNobody even knows what has caused this. It could just be a simple programming error. After all, the mugs that are affected are the ones that have the digital light up numbers.\n\nThe moms in every household try to calm the Dads down but for the most part the Dads are just angry and frustrated. They all are taking this mug thing a little bit too personal. \n\nAfter all, these mugs are given to them by children or their wives in most cases. Shouldn't those people's opinions matter more than some random programming error or some stranger changing everything? \n\nThese types of mugs have been given out for decades. Children are trying to tell their Dads that the mugs don't matter and they love them. The Dads are just struggling with confidence issues.\n\nThe next day all the Dads wake up and the mugs all say #1 Dad on them again. The Dads also have an email from the mug company explaining that there was a programming issue and all the mugs were changed to random digits. The Dads feel like idiots for overreacting. The Moms tell the dads they should take this as a learning lesson and stop getting so out of control over ego things.\n\nThe mugs should have never caused this kind of an issue. Men sometimes go a bit overboard with their ego. We can all learn from this scenario. Lets put our family first and our ego second. ",
