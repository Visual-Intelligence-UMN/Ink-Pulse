You had ended up getting called onto an emergency work trip that weekend and you had left the beer fest early. You remember that Soeurette had asked you to take a picture of her brother in the beer bikini that she had made for him. She had seemed overly flirtatious with him. You remember her warmth and closeness to him as the two of them interacted. You realize with great discomfort that the beer fest occurred five months prior to her pregnancy announcement. You begin to feel the pangs of jealousy and rage flood through your veins. You begin to feel mortified at the realization that Soeurette had cheated on you with Kaitlyn's husband, your best friend. You start to investigate the mug again. You see that your best friend is listed as the 30th best dad in the world. You feel your heart sink. Your best friend doesn't have any kids with Kaitlyn, but now you are certain that he is Harper's father. You realize that you have been absolutely used and cheated on. You are disgusted with Soeurette. You throw the mug against the wall and it shatters.",
