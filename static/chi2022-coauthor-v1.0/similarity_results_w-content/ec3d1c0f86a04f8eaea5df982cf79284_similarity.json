The bumble bee searched the field for flowers and then flew back to the princess. Zach is the bee's name by the way.\n\nHe is a girl bee and has a sister named Zara. So the bee says anyway. The bee is full of it. Because his name is really Mr. Jeff Bee's son. Mr. Bee's son is very lazy and he doesn't want to work. That is how he ended up as a bee. But Mr. Bee's son is not lazy he is just a big baby. That is how he ended up being Mr. Bee's son in the first place. He was born that way.",
