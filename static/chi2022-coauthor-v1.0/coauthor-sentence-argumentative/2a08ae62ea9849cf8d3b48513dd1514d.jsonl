I also think it would be a bad idea because it would cause more problems than it would solve because not everyone wants to go to college for sports, and would be unfair to others who did not want to participate in playing any sport for the college. Meaning people who went for science, engineering, IT, etc would have to maintain normal jobs to help them with their expenses while athletes get a free ride.\n\nI also think it would make colleges head hunt more for talented sports players than it would for people who could help advance science and math. So my stance is athletes should go to college for education, not because they can get paid.\n",
