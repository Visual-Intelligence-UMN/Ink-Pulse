The books are written in a way that makes it difficult for the student to understand what is being said because what it contains have little to do with the students' world.\n\nTeachers need to evaluate that world and acquire texts that describe and celebrate it. The students will then be able to read and understand what they are reading. A girl in East Harlem can read magazines and books that celebrate black and brown culture and heritage. A boy in Kansas can read books about farming, mechanics or outer space--whatever interests them.\n\nTeaching reading using a canon of approves texts is like teach a toddler how to eat by giving them spinach and raw carrots: it may work, but does not ignite either the passions or the imagination.  Students need to be allowed to read what they want, be it comic books, science fiction, whodunits or fashion magazines. And never mind if it is on a screen or on a page.\n\nSchools need to develop the habit of reading, never mind its object. Graduating students need to learn that when they are bored, or have a problem, or want to learn about something, the way to do that is to read about it.\n\nOnce a student has that habit, the whole world is theirs and a lifetime of learning can begin.\n\n\n\n\n",
