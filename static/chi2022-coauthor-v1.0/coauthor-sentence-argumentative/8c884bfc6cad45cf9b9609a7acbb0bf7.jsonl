Extreme sports are often not regulated, and encourage too high of a risk. \n\nExtreme sports affect future generations. Our children see extreme sports, and think this behavior is fine. They see the glory and fame that extreme sports bring, and think that this risky behavior is what they should be doing. \n\nExtreme sports affect the economy. Extreme sports are the cause of many expensive injuries. People place an unneeded burden on the healthcare system, for their own selfish reasons.  How many people have been delayed needed surgeries because the latest daredevil was jumping over 30 motorcycles, or broke a rib trying the newest stunt? \n\nExtreme sports also affect the environment. They bring people to pristine areas, lugging heavy plastic waste that is often discarded.  The trash pile on Mount Everest is a good example of this.\n\nNo, Extreme sports are not sports in the traditional sense, and should not be called sports. They are nothing more than selfish, risk-seeking behavior. \n",
