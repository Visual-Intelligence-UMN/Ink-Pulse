For example retail workers, would still work as well as other essential workers. I think beyond them , there are many other people that would not be able to work remotely out of both preference and necessity, and would still need to go into the office or other places of work. For them, it is more engaging to work in person with colleagues, and their fellow co-workers. Still, there are people who benefit from the remote work option, and after the pandemic ends will continue to do so. For that reason, I don't think that is reasonable to worry about the increase in usage and dependency of screen use from the pandemic, as when the pandemic subsides, it is likely that many will reduce their usage out of necessity, and for work, school, and social interactions. The benefits of screen use ought to be embraced during the pandemic and afterwards, for they allow people to stay connected when they are unable to, out of safety or for other personal reasons. Screen use will not cause most to depend on it solely in their lives, like written work and literature, many will learn over time to moderate it, and find a balance in their life regarding its usage to maximize its benefits.\n",
