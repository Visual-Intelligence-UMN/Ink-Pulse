Schools should make as many opportunities as possible for students to get paid. I think that if students are good at something, they should be paid for it. I think this is especially good in STEM fields because students who are good at STEM fields can make a lot of money. If they have good chances of making a lot of money professionally, why not let them get paid for their work now?
