People have their reasons for participating in sports like these and i dont think anyone should be limited as to what they can and can not do. It is simply their own decision. I know i personally have participated in violent sports all my life. I played football from the time i was a kid through graduating in college, and I am now doing boxing. To me, it is therapeutic to participate in sports like these because they challenge my mind and my athleticism. Working out to become better athlete is something that has always given me a goal, and something to drive for.

I would guess that many people who do extreme sports are adrenaline junkies in a way, and need this sort of action in their life as they cant get it from every day tasks. This in turn calms their mind and allows them to have something to look forward to that quenches their adrenaline. I just think that everyone has a purpose for what they do, and it is not someone else to tell them what they can and can not do. Of course there are situations where the action can be looked at as selfish, but to them it may not me. There could be a dad who has four kids, but still does mountain climbing. Maybe he wants to be a role model to the kids and show them how to face their fears. Or maybe he simply wants to calm his mind so he can be present, and be a good father. Not everyone does it for these good and genuine reasons, but who are we to pick and choose? \n",
