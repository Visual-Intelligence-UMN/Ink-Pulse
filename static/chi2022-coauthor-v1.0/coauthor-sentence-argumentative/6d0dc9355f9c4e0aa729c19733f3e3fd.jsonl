Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, the most offensive stereotypes are the ones that are used to make a character seem less than human. For instance, the idea that a person who is gay, or a person of color, or a woman, or an immigrant, or a person with disabilities is less of a person than someone who is straight, white, male, native-born and able-bodied.  Well known examples of this include the portrayal of the Native American as a savage, the portrayal of African Americans as lazy and stupid, the portrayal of women as weak and subservient to men. Each of these examples is offensive because it dehumanizes a group of people.  So, in the sense that I'm a person with high moral standards about how to treat my fellow humans, I view all of these as 'cringe worthy.'\n\nThe question of whether I would avoid reading a book or watching a movie because of a stereotyped portrayal, is a more difficult one. Is it possible for a work to be so well written that I can overlook the offensive portrayal? I find it hard to believe that I could ever do that, but I suppose it's possible. I think the problem is that I would have to be so caught up in the story that I wouldn't constantly notice the offensive portrayal.  Alternatively, the offensive portrayal could be a small enough part of the overall work that I could overlook it. In either of these cases, the stereotype wouldn't be enough to make me stop reading or watching.\n\nHowever, I find this unlikely. For the most part, a work that is offensive in this way is offensive because the author or director is trying to be offensive. So, the offensive portrayal is likely to be a large part of the work, or at least a large part of the author's or director's intent, and if the same stereotype doesn't occur constantly, other offensive stereotypes will. Also, the use of stereotypes suggests a lack of creativity on the part of the author or director. So, it's unlikely that the rest of the work will be so well written that I can overlook the offensive portrayal.\n",

        "text": "What Stereotypical Characters Make You Cringe?\n\nWhat stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, the most offensive stereotypes are the ones that are used to make a character seem less than human. For instance, the idea that a person who is gay, or a person of color, or a woman, or an immigrant, or a person with disabilities is less of a person than someone who is straight, white, male, native-born and able-bodied.  Well known examples of this include the portrayal of the Native American as a savage, the portrayal of African Americans as lazy and stupid, the portrayal of women as weak and subservient to men. Each of these examples is offensive because it dehumanizes a group of people.  So, in the sense that I'm a person with high moral standards about how to treat my fellow humans, I view all of these as 'cringe worthy.'\n\nThe question of whether I would avoid reading a book or watching a movie because of a stereotyped portrayal, is a more difficult one. Is it possible for a work to be so well written that I can overlook the offensive portrayal? I find it hard to believe that I could ever do that, but I suppose it's possible. I think the problem is that I would have to be so caught up in the story that I wouldn't constantly notice the offensive portrayal.  Alternatively, the offensive portrayal could be a small enough part of the overall work that I could overlook it. In either of these cases, the stereotype wouldn't be enough to make me stop reading or watching.\n\nHowever, I find this unlikely. For the most part, a work that is offensive in this way is offensive because the author or director is trying to be offensive. So, the offensive portrayal is likely to be a large part of the work, or at least a large part of the author's or director's intent, and if the same stereotype doesn't occur constantly, other offensive stereotypes will. Also, the use of stereotypes suggests a lack of creativity on the part of the author or director. So, it's unlikely that the rest of the work will be so well written that the stereotype would be particularly easy to overlook.\n\nWe live in a world where the use of stereotypes is so common that it's hard to avoid them. However, we also live in an era where people are becoming more aware of the harm that stereotypes cause. In this day and age, it's not so easy to write off stereotypes as mere lazy writing. It makes more sense to view them as a conscious choice to dehumanize people. Perhaps rather than merely avoiding these works, we should be calling them out for what they are, and calling on the creators to cease using them, and treat \n",
