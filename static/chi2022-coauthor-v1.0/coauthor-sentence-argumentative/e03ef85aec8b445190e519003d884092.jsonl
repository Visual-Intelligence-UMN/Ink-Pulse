I already see huge pushes for office workers to continue working from home. Even businesses are opening up to it since it cuts down on operating costs. As long productivity does not take a big hit. Then we have new technologies like VR, AR and holograms that will reduce the need even more to be physically present. I also see these new technologies being much more addictive then phones and desktops. These are fully immersive technologies that are becoming very realistic very fast. As I said before I am not anti screen, I am just very worried for our future when it comes to personal interaction at school and the workplace. I also think there should be much more focus on the effects of screen time since we are using it more and more. \n",
