We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.\n\nBut should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. \n\nThe evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us. \n\nWe are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children. I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. \n\nI am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development. Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, \"But Mommy, I'm almost done.\" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying \"no\" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.\n\nThe thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. \n\nI don't want my seven year old daughter \n",

Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, \"But Mommy, I'm almost done.\" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying \"no\" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.\n\nThe thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. \n\nI don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, \"But Mommy, I'm almost done.\" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, \"But Mommy, I'm watching a movie.\"\n",

I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.\n\nThe thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. \n\nI don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, \"But Mommy, I'm almost done.\" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, \"But Mommy, I'm watching a movie.\" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.\n\nThat's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time.

We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.\n\nBut should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. \n\nThe evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us. \n\nWe are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children. I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. \n\nI am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development. Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, \"But Mommy, I'm almost done.\" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying \"no\" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.\n\nThe thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. \n\nI don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, \"But Mommy, I'm almost done.\" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, \"But Mommy, I'm watching a movie.\" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.\n\nThat's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life. And screen time is not all bad. For example,  I think that screen time can be a great educational tool. One game Harper really enjoys is called \"Math Bingo.\" She's learning math while playing the game. And she's learning to read while playing \"Sesame Street.\"\n",

Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. \n\nThe evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us. \n\nWe are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children. I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. \n\nI am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development. Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, \"But Mommy, I'm almost done.\" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying \"no\" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.\n\nThe thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. \n\nI don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato, since that could negatively effect her health. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, \"But Mommy, I'm almost done.\" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, \"But Mommy, I'm watching a movie.\" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.\n\nThat's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life. And screen time is not all bad. For example,  I think that screen time can be a great educational tool. One game Harper really enjoys is called \"Math Bingo.\" She's learning math while playing the game. And she's learning to read while playing \"Sesame Street.\" But at the same time I just really don't want to go down a rabbit hole with Harper where she's just sitting on her iPad all day. Growing kids need to be active and they need to be social. So this is where I come out on this issue, and I'm sure that there are many other parents out there who feel the same way. \n",
