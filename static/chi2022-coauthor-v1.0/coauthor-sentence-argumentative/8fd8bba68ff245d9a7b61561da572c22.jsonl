Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.\n\nWhen I face challenges today in my job, I think back about certain tasks in school that focused on creativity.  For example, in one of my classes we had to write a series of papers that were judged by the class.  At first, I was very afraid to write outside of the norm.  My classmates judged those papers very harshly.  \n",
