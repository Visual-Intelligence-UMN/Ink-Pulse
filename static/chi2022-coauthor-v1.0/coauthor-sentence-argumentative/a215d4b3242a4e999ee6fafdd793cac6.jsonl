And services like Audible can ensure a steady supply of books for listeners for a relatively small subscription payment.\n\nThat brings us up to the present. And now we are in a position to answer the question: what is the benefit of audiobooks? In this context, the clear benefit is that audiobooks can empower the disabled and enable those with vision issues to fully participate in the world of books and literature as never before.\n\nAudiobooks are a beacon of equal rights and equal access for the disabled, and as such should be subsidized and expanded.\n\nDo you agree?
