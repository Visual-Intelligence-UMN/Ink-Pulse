Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, there is nothing worse than reading about a cliché character. Too many times have I read a book that seems like the author just read one too many romance novels and decided to copy character profiles. \n\nThe woman in these stories can only wear heels, she is always ready for her hair to be blown around at the slightest sign of wind, beautiful as a goddess, naïve and a virgin. As she has been waiting for love, she also knows that gold diggers and poseurs don't deserve her undying love. \n\n\nThe man in these stories is a boss, a millionaire, a hero, he must travel the world and have women fawning over him.  Her long awaited Prince Charming cannot be less than movie-star handsome, he must play ball with orphans, and he has to read books too. He will never think of the woman that holds his heart as an equal, but an object to be worshiped.\n\n\nCharacters like this need to die already! I want to read stories about women who are college educated--yes, I'm that type of woman, and I know plenty of others who are too. I want to read about men who are real--men who have flaws and dreams and those who don't need to be in the spotlight. Characters like that aren't perfect, but they are real... and they can still have love in their lives. \n\nI won't read books or watch television with such lazy writing. It isn't healthy, \n",
