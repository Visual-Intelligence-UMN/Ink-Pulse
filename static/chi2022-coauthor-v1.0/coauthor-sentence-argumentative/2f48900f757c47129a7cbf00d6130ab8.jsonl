        "text": "Is It Wrong to Focus on Animal Welfare When Humans Are Suffering?\n\nWould you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.\n\nWhy do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, it is such a shallow thing when you try to say \"we should care for everyone in this planet,\" or something like, \"we should care for everyone equally.\" which is in the surface, probably sound very good intentioned and probably the correct mentality to have, but unless a person has the capability to treat every single one of the 7 billion people here in the planet today, it's all just a big lie.\n\nIn reality, you as a person care more for people and animals that you know rather than someone from a different country or a different continent. You care more for your family, friends, and people you know than a stranger. You're not going to pick a random stranger to sleep with you on a hotel room against your own family, right? That's going to be the same reason how you will care more for the welfare of an animal you know and love, rather than someone else that you don't know in the world.\n\nIt's very easy to say \"I care for everyone equally,\" but in reality, it's not. Billionaires who have the capability to help everyone in the world, they will care more for their own family, friends, and people they know than a random stranger. So if billionaires are unable to help the humans that are already suffering, what more for a person like you, who is just a normal person? What's easier, to feed, to groom, and to play with your dog, or to make sure someone in Africa is needing their basic necessity? I know it's a hard question to answer, but that's the reality. Even if you have spent a lot of time to help someone in Africa, there's still someone, somewhere who is suffering and you will not have the capability to change that.\n\nSo, in my opinion, it's not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. We are normal people. We should be focusing on the billionaires and the people who have the capability to help everyone in the world, rather than a normal person like you and me. It's not a question about morality and ethics, but it's a question about capability. It's not about trying to get rid of responsibility for your own kind, but it is to focus on the people who can do something about it. So I hope, Jeff Bezos, \n",
