It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.\n\nAs for people who devote themselves primarily to animal welfare causes over humans, I would not say it is wrong to do so. For perhaps they believe it is a more effective use of their time, and that such causes may not be valued by others who pursue causes or issues that affects humans. As long as those people are aware of all of the suffering that is taking place all around the world, and are actively sharing their findings and efforts to help animals and humans, they can be free to devote themselves to a cause they deem is critical to be resolved by their efforts. It is true the help of the many as opposed to individual efforts that both human and animal welfare initiatives can be successful, and they both require accurate information and efforts to achieve a positive outcome. A person should not be viewed as unethical or immoral for devoting themselves for one cause over the other, as others will still help such cause, and they may assist indirectly or through other means.\n",
