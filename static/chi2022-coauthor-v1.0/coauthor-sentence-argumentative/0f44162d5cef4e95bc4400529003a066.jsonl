Thinking critically helps me identify when information is falsified, and potentially inaccurate. It gives me an initiative to learn more about the topic, and to also learn more about the subject matter. That way I avoid claiming what I read or heard about as accurate, when it may as well be false and misleading. This is true of what claims is posted on social media, but also what I hear from people in person, and in the conversations that I hold. Thinking critically goes hand to hand with the ability to being flexible in ones beliefs, as you should reconsider positions when information is learned that changes how you view things, and that is more alligned with your informed beliefs and perceptions. \n\nOverall, I think thinking more in depth regarding the world around me and effectively thinking critically is something I will continue to use in the future. It helps me in my work, where I am to analyze information and create reports from it. It helps in my personal interests, for me to be better informed in my choices to avoid mistakes, as well as misinforming others about false claims or information. For that, I think it is one of the thing students ideally should learn from school. I think as connected as people are in today's world, it is useful for many to be able to think critically on what they read and hear about on social media and other outlets. Many issues will be avoided if people are able to perceive false information as such, and they would be able to inform themselves properly to make decisions that affects not only themselves, but the lives of others as well.\n\n",
