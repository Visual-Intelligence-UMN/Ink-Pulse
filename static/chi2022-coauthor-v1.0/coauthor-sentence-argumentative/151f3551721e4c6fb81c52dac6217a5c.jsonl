If you believe opposite attract you can put in the characteristics you desire in a partner and search that way or find someone who has a lot in common with you as most do. Using apps to find love has never been so easy and common place. It used to be a fringe thing, then the younger generations started to embrace it and the rest was history. Now I would now have it any other way. I am sure it also helps you to be who you are (if you're honest) because so much is known about you before the first in person date.  \n",

Its also hard for me to describe how good it is to weed out the people who you know will not work. \nDating apps and tech is the way to go. Its the best way to find the partner you are specifically looking for (within reason of course). It simply gives you a whole ocean at your finger tips instead of the small pond around your town.  \n",
