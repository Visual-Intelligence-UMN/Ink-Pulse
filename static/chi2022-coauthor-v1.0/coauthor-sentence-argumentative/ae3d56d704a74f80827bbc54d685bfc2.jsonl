Since the dawn of time, people have managed to establish intimate relationships by meeting each other in real life, gradually learning to trust one another, and eventually being at the point to where they really want to begin a relationship with each other. 21st century technological developments have only added a layer of bizarre complexity to this process, and have further isolated people to the point where this process fails before it can even begin.\n\nDating apps are the greatest example of this. I've used them, and the experience is not unlike playing online poker, or playing video games — the main point of it is to kill time in lieu of having better things to do. The way the time killing process works with them, is that, you open up the app, conveniently right around the time you would otherwise go to bed, and start swiping through dozens of unappealing or phony users until you find one or two that you like, and begin exchanging messages with them, which might then end in a flaky or disconnected face-to-face interaction, which might then end in a crappy date that doesn't lead to anything further, which then leads you back to the beginning with yet more profiles of people you don't have anything in common with, and who you don't really want to meet. This does nothing to build a foundation of trust and rapport, and it does nothing to help people connect with each other.\n\nNetflix is a mere time waster, it's much like going to a video store, only with thousands of titles rather than hundreds, few of which either you or a prospective partner will have any interest in watching, and the whole process is more likely to result in awkward silence and resentment over poor viewing choices, than a romantic connection.  Texting is very much the same way — the only difference is that it sucks even more time out of your day, and takes more from your life, as you fail over and over to communicate \n",
