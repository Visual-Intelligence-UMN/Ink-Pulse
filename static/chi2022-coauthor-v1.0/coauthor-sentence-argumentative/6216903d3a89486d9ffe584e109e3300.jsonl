        "text": "Should College Athletes Be Paid?\n\nDo you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?\n\nIn “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,\" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.\"\n\nDo you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. \n\nHear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.\n\nHowever, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.\n\nThe athletes can also pinpoint or select a charity that they would like to donate the money to. Because even though these athletes do not need compensation because of their lifestyle that they are living, they should still be able to have a say in where their money goes. Too much loss of life and suffering we are experiencing because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any excess money from the NCAA can help those who are in need.\n\nSo, just to reiterate, you have gotten to know my point: I do not think that college athletes should be paid, but I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off\n",
