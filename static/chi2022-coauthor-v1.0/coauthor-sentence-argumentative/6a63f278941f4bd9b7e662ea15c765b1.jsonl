People need to meet, they need to interact in person and need to exchange all the information that comes with being next to a real person. There should be an option on the dating apps that tell a potential match that they must meet in person soon after they agree that they are possibly compatible. So in my mind, the old fashioned way is still the best but using dating sites for the initial meeting is understandable but physically being with a person on a date is far superior to just having interactions over the internet. \n",
