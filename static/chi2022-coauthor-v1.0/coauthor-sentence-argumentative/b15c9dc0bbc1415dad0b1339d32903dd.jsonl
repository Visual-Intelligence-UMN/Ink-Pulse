How so?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. \n\nI've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.\n\nThe only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama.

Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.\n\nThe only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama. I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of her fiance Matt's ex-girlfriend that she hacked into her Facebook and Instagram accounts and started posting some really mean things about her. It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.\n\nSo in conclusion, I think that technology is generally a good thing for dating and relationships, but it can be a bad thing if you're not careful. Just don't get sucked into petty drama through technology and instead use technology to enhance your relationship and make it stronger. That's what I do, and it's worked out pretty well for me. My boyfriend and I are going strong and it's all thanks to the wonderful world of technology.\n",
