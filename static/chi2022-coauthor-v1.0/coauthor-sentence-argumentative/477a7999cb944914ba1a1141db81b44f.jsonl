A fair amount of football players --particularly in the high school and college ranks--suffer from post-concussion syndrome (which may not present itself for several months after the injury), and can effect them for the rest of their lives, and several players have suffered neck injuries that have resulted in permanent paralysis. Boxing, of course, is another sport that has a decidedly high risk of injury and death, as does MMA, while even sports that don't involve hard impacts with other players, like baseball and tennis, have their own unusual dangers, such as flying balls and obstacles that result in serious injury, and track competitors risk sprains or broken limbs from hurdles, high jumps and the long jump.  Even golfers , whose sport is considered relatively safe in the grand scheme of things, can suffer minor injuries like chronic arthritis from repetitive motion, and serious injuries and even death by lightning strikes.\n\nMy point is, that the risks of engaging in sports, are already high, and are inherent, and expected. Perhaps sports that mean certain death should be banned, but barring that, I can't see preventing competition in extreme sports, because if that were to occur, many just as dangerous (or even more so) existing sports would need to be banned as well,  which would lead to very few sports in which an athlete could lawfully compete.\n",
