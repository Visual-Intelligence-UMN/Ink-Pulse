Netflix is just another way to do that, the 21st century way.\n\nSocial Media has made it easier to stay in touch with friends and family, and has also made it easier to meet new people to date. I think its effects have also been generally positive. The only downsides are that it can be a distraction, and it can be used to spread negativity. Checking up on a partner's social media accounts can be a good way to see if they are being honest, but it can also turn into a way to spy on them. Again, though, before social media existed, paranoid people would still check up on their partners, and it caused the same problems in relationships then, that it does now.

Thanks to Tinder and OkCupid, I have been able to meet and date some really cool people. In fact, I am currently dating someone I met on Tinder. I met her at a bar, but we connected on Tinder first. The first date went well and we have been seeing each other ever since. I think that we would have never met if it weren't for Tinder. I believe this relationship will last because we have a lot in common and we are both very similar.\n\nWhen it comes to Netflix, I think the effect on dating and relationships is neutral, and trivial. Before Netflix, people would go out to the movies on dates, or rent a movie, or watch TV. Netflix is just another way to do that, the 21st century way.\n\nSocial Media has made it easier to stay in touch with friends and family, and has also made it easier to meet new people to date. I think its effects have also been generally positive. The only downsides are that it can be a distraction, and it can be used to spread negativity. Checking up on a partner's social media accounts can be a good way to see if they are being honest, but it can also turn into a way to spy on them. Again, though, before social media existed, paranoid people would still check up on their partners, and it caused the same problems in relationships then, that it does now. Social media is just a new way to do it.\n\nTexting is a great way to stay in touch with people, and it is also a great way to flirt. Emojis are a great way to easily express flirtatious or emotional sentiments, and texting enables plenty of that. Texting is also quick, and convenient, and not only does it enable new relationships to blossom, it helps to maintain existing relationships and keep them strong and healthy.\n\nIn short, technology has been a great boon to dating and relationships.
