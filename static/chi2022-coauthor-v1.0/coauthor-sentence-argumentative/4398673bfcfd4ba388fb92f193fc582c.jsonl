But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.

I mean, they do get a scholarship for their athletic ability, and some even get a partial scholarship because of their grades. If they weren't getting scholarships, I'd definitely be all for paying them. Of course, they'd have to figure out how much they'd be paid. Do college athletes realize that they are essentially being paid over $350,000 to play on their teams, because the value of the scholarships will pay tuition for four years, room fees, and food every day? It just shocks me that these students don't appreciate their scholarships, because many people would die just for a chance at getting a scholarship by the age of 18.\n\nI come from a family that doesn't have a lot of money, and I've seen the struggles they have gone through to make sure their children get an education. I mean, my mom is about to get her third job, in order to give the kids in our family an opportunity to go college, when she has already done her fair share by having two jobs on top of all her responsibilities at home. I have a lot of respect for her when it comes to what she has to do in order to put us through school, and it hurts me that college athletes aren't grateful for the opportunities they've been given. No, they don't get paid for all of their hard work they put in daily, but their scholarship covers it. And if they want to give up their scholarships they'll have to pay for their own education just like the rest of us do. Would they rather have that or a scholarship? They just can't have their cake and eat it too. That wouldn't be fair to the rest of us who can't afford college and still have to pay for it on our own.\n",
