In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart.

I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. \n\nThe average woman menstruates for about 30 years. Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! \n\nI cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. \n\nSo no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon. So schools should just start finding the resources to provide free pads and tampons to students.\n",
