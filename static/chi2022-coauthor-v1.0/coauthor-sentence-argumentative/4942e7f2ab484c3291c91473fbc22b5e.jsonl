What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.\n\nIt's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.\n\nSo acquiring these skills was easy, but what about learning how to become a decent human being? My friends, and the kids in my neighborhood, were not always good role models.\n",
