        "sentence": "You're Barack Obama. 4 years into your retirement, you awake to find a letter with no return address on your bedside table. It reads \"I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job.\" Signed simply, \"JFK.\"\n\nYou're shocked. This has to be a joke. JFK has been dead for ages. There is even a video of him getting shot in the head. Surely you are just being trolled by someone. At the end of the day, your curiosity gets the best of you.\n\nYou call the number and a man picks up. You tell him that you're Barack Obama and got the letter that was sent and marked by a JFK. The man tells you to hold on and transfers you to another line.\n\nYou hear a man pick up and he claims that he is John F. Kennedy. You tell him that's impossible and that JFK has been dead for decades. He explains that he has been alive the entire time and wanted to get out of the limelight. The entire assassination was staged similar to a movie.\n\nJFK used a stunt double and effects to make it look real. You sit there and tell JFK you want proof. He sends you a picture of his license as well as pictures from his past in his wallet. He also shows you his new license that has a fake name on it as well.\n\nYou sit there shocked and have no idea how to react. JFK tells you that he has a job for you and that you will be paid handsomely. He tells you to pack your bags and that you will be picked up in a few hours.\n\nA few hours later you are picked up and are going to a unknown destination.

You tell JFK that you would love to help but don't know where to start. JFK tells you that he has a plan and that he will explain it to you on the way. He explains that you that he is going to infiltrate the Illumanti and destroy them from the inside. His new alias is the 3rd richest person in the world.\n\nYou are shocked at this information as well and get uncomfortable. You tell JFK that you're too afraid to help and want to go back to your wife and children. JFK gets very upset and tells you that you clearly don't care about your country. You go back home and are confident that you made the right decision. While you value your country, there is too many things that could go wrong and harm you or your family. You made the right call.",
