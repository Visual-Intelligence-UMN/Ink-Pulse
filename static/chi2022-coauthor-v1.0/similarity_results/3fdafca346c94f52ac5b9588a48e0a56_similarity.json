Apparently all of the #1 Dad mugs in the world have been randomly changing ranking to reflect the actual ranking of dads. So now I'm #4 Dad. I figured #4 is still really good so I wasn't too worried about it. \n\nThe next day I pulled out my mug and it had changed to \"#5 Dad.\" I wondered why it had gone down. I called my dad and he said, \"I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted again.\" So I decided that that week, I would be the best dad I could, in effort to make the ranking go back up to #1. I played with my kids, I took them to the park, I helped them with their homework, I even went to the grocery store with my wife and helped pick out their favorite meals. My two kids and my wife were both very appreciative. \n\nThe next morning I pulled out my mug and it had changed to \"#3 Dad.\" I was so happy that my ranking had gone back up again. I decided that I would continue my added efforts in being a good dad. I would do whatever it took to get back to #1",

The mug, which had always read \"#1 Dad\" suddenly changed to \"#4 Dad.\" I didn't understand why this was happening so I decided to call my dad. \"Dad, I just pulled out my #1 Dad mug and it changed to #4 Dad.\" I told him. And he said, \"Oh, I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted.\" I didn't understand. But he told me about a news story he saw last night.

In the end though, mystery unsolved, I decided that I enjoyed being a better dad. Ranking or not, I continued that way from then on and we were all a happy family from that day forth. ",
