I was not technically a dad, but still a step-dad. I figured i would still be on the list since i did all i could do to raise the kids in the best way i knew how. I wasnt sure if i was dreaming or if this was real, however in the moment all i cared about was looking at the list on my mug. I didnt even take a sip of the coffee. My mouth was open and my eyes were focused on the mug. I thought maybe i should make sure my eyes werent playing tricks on me. Alas, there it was. I saw my name. I read the number beside my name.  I was #1 Dad. I wasnt sure if it was real or not. I didnt feel anything. I just....... looked.  I quickly began to look at the rankings of all the other dads. What makes me any better than anyone else? I wasnt even a biological father, am i really doing that well? I know that i loved the kids, and maybe that was all that mattered. I know that i would do anything for them, as i am sure many other dads would. What made be stand apart? I know there are plenty of dads who work just as hard as i do, and they deserve to be #1 too. I turned the mug around, looked on the bottom and everywhere i could think of. Is there some sort of explanation or criteria for this? I want to know what it is exactly i am doing so well? Why do i always question when someone compliments me? I am not perfect, i know that. Why do i not believe this list, despite the kids and my fiancee never saying anything but good about me? All that mattered to me were the kids knowing that i was there for them. Knowing that i would do whatever they needed me for. All this mug was doing was making me question myself, but maybe that is why I am #1. Maybe I am because i am my toughest critic. Maybe I am because i am selfless and just want to make others happy. Maybe I am #1 because of how others think of me? Why cant i think of me the same way they do? Why cant i just enjoy this? I dont know the answer to any of these questions...",
