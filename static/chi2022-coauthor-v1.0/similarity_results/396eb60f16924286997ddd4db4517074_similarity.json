The robot grabbed a gun from it's holster and shot the alien with a lightning bolt. The alien fell to the ground and perished. \n\nThe only issue was how was the robot supposed to get to Damon without the ability to move. Damon thought on his feet and went up to the robot. He hit the reset button and when the robot booted back up Damon was able to program it and communicate with it. Luckily for Damon, the robot understood what he was saying and was able to rescue Damon and get back in contact with the government. The US government sent a rocket to them and they were able to get home safe and sound. ",
