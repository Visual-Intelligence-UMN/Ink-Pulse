The elevator descended to the floor below, and then kept going and going. It was not to the lower floor, but to another section of the facility. It went down so far they couldn't fathom how far underground they had gone. Then, the elevator stopped and the doors opened.

We shouldn't mess with this stuff.\" your best friend said. Suddenly, the elevator doors closed and the elevator lifted up away, leaving them in the deep basement. They were stuck. They went to press the elevator buttons, but there weren't any. A few moments later, the doors opened and a mysterious figure walked in.
