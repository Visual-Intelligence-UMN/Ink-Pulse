You ask the bee what you should do. The bee says that you should return to the hive, and that you will be welcomed with open arms. \"How can I return to the hive? I am huge and a human, and I certainly wouldn't fit.\" The bee tells you that as you get closer to your hive of origin you will return to your original form and become an insect once again. You aren't really sure you like this idea. For one, you have convinced yourself that bees will bring you harm. For another, you really like your human life and family. You ask the bee if you can stay the way you are. The bee says that the queen of bees can never be anything but a bee.",
