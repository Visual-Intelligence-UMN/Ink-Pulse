I am huge and a human, and I certainly wouldn't fit.\" The bee tells you that as you get closer to your hive of origin you will return to your original form and become an insect once again. You aren't really sure you like this idea. For one, you have convinced yourself that bees will bring you harm. For another, you really like your human life and family.
