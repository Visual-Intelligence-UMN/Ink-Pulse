He works on screenplays while he is with them, and then when he returns to Earth he works on making those into movies.  Over the next 20 years, he is involved in over 10 movies, all of which are blockbusters that introduce the world to new ideas and realities.  Everyone is happy with the arrangement.\n\nIn 2041, the Earth is attacked by aliens from a different planet than Damon's aliens.  Damon's friends spring into action and before they can take over they blow up the attacker's ships and send those remaining back to their galaxies, knowing that they can't mess with Earth.  The message spreads through the universe and for centuries, even after Damon's eventual death, the Earth was safe from attack.  ",
