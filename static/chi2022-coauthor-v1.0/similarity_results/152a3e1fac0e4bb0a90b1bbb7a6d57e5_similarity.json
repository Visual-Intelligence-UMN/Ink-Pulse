She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time. \n\nIf she knew he were a shapeshifter, she would be upset for sure. But he's able to convince her each time that it's the real him, and not a copy. This time, the man has shifted into someone with a superhero like character. He has her thinking he's a real superhero now, with superpowers. Whenever they meet up, he pretends he has just saved the life of an innocent stranger who was in trouble. Can she ever see through his charade? And why won't he tell her who he really is? One day she sees him out and later catches him in a lie about his superhero activities. She confronts him, and he reveals the truth. She doesn't believe him at first because it just sounds like more superhero nonsense.

He was just telling me what I wanted to hear, she realized. She knew that he did this because she could never accept the real him, an invisible man. She let him down gently by telling him she was sorry but it was over. She couldn't be with an invisible person, but even more, she couldn't be with someone that wasn't honest from the start.",
