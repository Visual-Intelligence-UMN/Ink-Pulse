It is a safe feeling for a human. \n\nSome humans have the belief that when we die and move on, we go to a better place. That is the most comforting thought in regards to death. To many people, the afterlife is better than this Earth. Getting to spend life with the Holy Father, the Lord, God is what they believe their life's purpose is. Heaven is a wonderful place to be.",
