Before Xztylus could even get out of his seat, the humans had already broken through the security measures and were now in the room with the cage. Matt Damon thanked all of his rescuers, and then asked that everyone leave the ship alone. \"Thank you everyone, but I think we have done enough, and I'm sure the aliens know better than to mess with us humans now. Let's just all go home.\"\n\nCharmed, the humans all agreed and went back to their ships. Matt Damon asked to be given some private time alone in a room, which was of course granted.\n\nAs the door closed, he pulled a small device from his pocket. Pushing several buttons a holographic screen appeared, with a very surprised looking image of Xztylus on it.\n\n\"What, where did you get that, and how do you know how to use it?!? What are you humans!\" Xztylus, stammered, still shaken.\n\nMatt Damon smiled and spoke in Xztylus's native lanquage. \"And this, Xztylus, is why you'll never be promoted. You failed the test, again. Pretty weak of you to get beaten by humans of all creature. Head back to the homeworld and get ready for permanent desk duty.\" And just before turning off the device Matt Damon winked at Xztylus, his eyes shining the bright red of Xztylus' species for just a moment.\n",
