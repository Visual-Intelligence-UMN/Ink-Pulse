She doesn't understand it, but she's starting to come to the realization that he is, in fact, the same man she just broke up with. She suspects that he is the same man she's broken up with many times. The realization that she's dating the same person over and over again is staggering.\n\nShe asks him to leave, again. This time, he begs her not to ask him to go away. He begins weeping. She is stunned by what is going on. She has seen this act before. She walks to the door, opens it, and curtly says, \"goodnight.\" He leaves, but never takes his eyes off of her. She turns around, a bit spooked. Later that night she searches the internet for clues about what was going on with him. She is shocked to find that many women have had this same experience. She reads about shapeshifters and knows, in her heart, that this is what she's been dating. The woman joins the foreign legion and ships off, later that week. She never dates anyone again.",
