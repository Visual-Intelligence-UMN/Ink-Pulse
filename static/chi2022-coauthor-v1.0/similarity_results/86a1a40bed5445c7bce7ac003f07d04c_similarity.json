        "sentence": "An alien has kidnapped Matt Damon, not knowing what lengths humanity goes through to retrieve him whenever he goes missing. He's being guarded by Ben Affleck, whose sole purpose in life is to protect Matt Damon from all threats, but Ben needed to use the bathroom. In the time it takes Batman to pee, Matt Damon was kidnapped and brought onto a space ship. \n\nBen rushes back to the room and sees a single piece of paper where Matt Damon once sat. It reads:\n\"Dear Ben Affleck,\nSince you didn't protect Matt Damon from being taken, I'm not giving you the chance to find him. Contact no one.\"\nAnd it was signed with a strange squiggly line in an unfamiliar shape. \n\n\"I don't know what to do\" Ben says to himself. He can't keep this to himself, Matt has a family and friends, movies to film and an Oscar to win. Everyone knows they rarely leave each others sides. All Ben can think to do is disappear himself. \n\nIn the mean time, Matt was taken to a far away planet. His captors were fans and very friendly to boot! They kidnapped him because they were so in love with his acting, specifically his role as Jason Bourne. Matt briefly thinks of Ben and wonders what his friend thinks happened, but he's in space. SPACE! He's filmed movies as an astronaut. He's spent a whole movie on Mars! But now he really was in space!\n\nBack home the Matt's family was growing concerned that they couldn't reach Matt or Ben. The media was becoming confused as to \"Where is Matt and why doesn't his family care that he's missing?\" and \"Where is Ben and why didn't he protect Matt?\"\n\nBut life goes on, Matt's family soon realizes he likely left to film another Ocean's movie and failed to tell them (he can be selfish at times). Ben's family realizes their lives are much more peaceful without the constant \"OMG MATT DAMON IS MY BFF\" chatter. \n\nBut what about Matt? It's been months! But to Matt, it's felt like only hours. He is flying in a space ship, in outer space. There are planets and stars, life beyond humans. Animals that you can't even explain. There are food replicators, time travel, warp speed. There is nothing for Matt back home, his family will be fine without him, they barely miss him. The media has found a new star to dote on while Matt is living on a literal star. \n\nBen, however, has let the media cover that he is missing Matt Damon. He's struggling every day, he's confused that no one is searching for him, that no one misses him. He sits on a bench, overlooking the ocean and wonders if Matt is out there somewhere. As if he thought the words out loud, Matt appears. \n\n\"You want to go on a trip, buddy?\"\n\"MATT!\" Ben rushes to his side and wraps his arms around him. \n\"I'll go anywhere with you. Always\" and gently kisses his cheek.\nA light shines down and his body warms. And suddenly, the beach is gone and in it's place he and Matt are standing in a shiny silver room. \n\"It's space, Ben. We are on an alien spaceship\". Matt prompts. \n\"I don't care where I am, as long as I'm with you.\"\n\nThe ship shoots into space, best friends together again and for always.",
