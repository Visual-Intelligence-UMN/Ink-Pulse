The peacemakers are thrilled that their research and efforts have been so effective, and they return to all of the pilots to the US for a celebration. Suddenly, one of the pilots sends out a distress signal. Then another one comes in and another. Terrified, the US government and the peacemakers listen to the terrified calls. Aliens are attacking the planet and destroying everything. It seems they had been controlling the peacemakers actions over the years in an effort to take over the world. The chemical that was released on April first has taken away any instinct humans would have had to fight the aliens off and save ourselves. How appropriate is was released on the first of April.
