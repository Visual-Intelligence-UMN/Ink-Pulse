You speak to the bee, asking, \"why do you call me Your Majesty?\" The bee responds with a trumpet interlude, then an explanation that you were born to be the king of the bees. This perplexes you. If you were to be the king of bees, then why was everyone always telling you to fear the bee's sting? You ask this very question to the bee.\n\nThe bee tells you that your family and associates were trying to protect you from a difficult life in bee politics. They wanted you to experience a simpler life than that. Bees are known to be very tough negotiators, though most people are unaware of that fact. Since you are a human however, you are probably incapable of handling the pressure. The bee dismisses these concerns though, and tells you that it is your destiny and that you should have faith in your abilities. Though you are still doubtful, you are charmed by the bee's persistence.\n\nYou inform the bee that you will need time to acclimate to bee culture. You want to be informed of any and all legislation that is proposed in the bee council. The bee agrees to the logic of this cautionary approach and soon you are learning all about the bee world. You're astonished by the intricacies of bee society.\n\nBees all have different personalities and they are very thoughtful, once you get to know them. You begin to think of the bees as your children, and you care for them. You spend many hours talking to the bees about their problems and their aspirations. When you are finally ready to give your first order to the bees, it is an order to form a great celebration. You want a grand coronation as king of all bees. The bees are overjoyed, and they begin preparations immediately.",

        "sentence": "Your entire life, you've been told you're deathly allergic to bees. You've always had people protecting you from them, be it your mother or a hired hand. Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\" You stand in disbelief, not sure whether to run in fear or to give the bee some kind of an order. A ladybug sitting on a nearby flower watches you and thinks to herself, \"If I were in his place, I'd run for it.\"\n\nYou decide that the ladybug is probably right, but this is far to interesting of a situation to not explore. You gain control of yourself, get your fear under control and gather your thoughts.
