She explains to him that she has been hurt in the past by other men and is just afraid to take a risk. The man takes a deep breath and ends up admitting to her that he has the ability to shape-shift.\n\nThe woman doesn't understand what that means. She asks him what shapeshifting is and he explains that he can change forms. He can turn into other people, animals, inanimate objects, etc. The woman is shocked and asks the man what he really looks like. The man says that she has seen him in his original form the entire time. He explains that he doesn't like to abuse that ability and prefers to show his real self for better or worse.\n\nThe woman begins to soften up to the man as he was honest with her. She asks him how she's supposed to trust that what she sees really is his original form. He tells her that he will show her that he can only turn into things that are within a 50 foot area. He invites her to his home and she goes and sees that he's actually telling the truth.\n\nThe woman is emotional and tells the man that she appreciated how honest he was. She agrees to go on another date with the man. He tells her that he understands she has trust issues and will never break her trust. His number one priority is to be loyal and honest. The woman ends up dating the man for years and they finally agree to get married. The woman is shocked that she was able to get over her past issues but she knows this man is the one. He has always been honest with her, he has always been loyal to her. She really believes that he will never do anything to ever hurt her.\n\nAnd she ended up being correct. The two ended up getting married and had 4 children. They are currently living together and are in their 60s. They rarely ever have any fights and have a love that is still as strong as the day they met. Although it was an interesting and unique relationship, it is one that many people would die to have. Two people with genuine long lasting love for one another.",
