The man was interesting and told her that he was single and left her his number. She was so excited. She was going to call him and see what he was doing next Friday night. She called the man and asked if he was free Friday and he said he was. She took control and asked the man if he wanted to go to a movie. The man was fine with that and told her he couldn't wait to see her.\n\nFriday had arrived and the two met at the movies. They saw a very romantic movie and even held hands. The man ended up driving the woman home and gave her a good night kiss. The woman was melting inside at the idea that she finally had found a man that was as interested in her as she was in him. \n\nThe two continued to date and the woman was so happy. She had finally found the man she was looking for. The issue for her is the man was not who she thought he was. He would go to bars and flirt with girls all the time. He would go on dates and sweep women off their feet and then break their hearts. He wasn't a man who was willing to commit. He just liked to play the game.\n\nThe woman found that out the hard way. She thought things were going perfectly until she saw him in a bar making out with another girl. She confronted him and broke things off and was distraught. She had finally found the man she was looking for and he was a player. She was so upset that she went to a different bar and got drunk. She was so upset that she didn't even notice the man who was sitting at the bar watching her. \n\nThe man was watching the woman and couldn't help but notice how upset she was. He couldn't help but feel bad for her. He wanted to go over and talk to her, but he didn't want to come off as a creep. He wanted to help her feel better.",

        "sentence": "A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.\n\nOne day, she meets a man who’s everything she’s ever wanted. She’s certain he’s the one, but she’s also certain she’s going to lose him. She has had relationships like that in the past. She gets so close to someone and then something happens where they drift apart and she gets her heart broken. \n\nShe’s determined to not let that happen again. She’s going to hold on to this one. He's going to be the one. She knows it based off the first time she saw him. He was in a bar, and she was with her friends. He was so handsome, and he was staring at her. She felt it deep within her soul. She had to make a move. She told her friends she had to go to the bathroom and instead veered off and went up to the man to introduce herself.\n\nThe man offered to buy her a drink and the two had a conversation that went pretty well. The man was interesting and told her that he was single and left her his number. She was so excited. She was going to call him and see what he was doing next Friday night. She called the man and asked if he was free Friday and he said he was. She took control and asked the man if he wanted to go to a movie.

He went up to her and offered to take her home. She was inebriated and agreed which could have been dangerous. Luckily, the man was a good man and took her home. He left her his number.\n\nThe next day the woman woke up and saw that number and had no idea what happened. She called that person and he explained to her what happened. He asked her if they could meet up and she agreed. She wanted to meet a man who comforted her at her most vulnerable. A full year went by and they got along, dated and the man ended up proposing to her. They are scheduled to marry in about 4 months. As for the shapeshifter, he ended up losing that ability and everyone began to see him for what he was. A man who had Napoleon complex and was actually 5 feet 2. He was trying to live a life that he thought he would love but at the end of the day, he forever remained unhappy and unfulfilled. The woman dodged a bullet.",
