Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\"\n\nYou stand perfectly still. There is a bee on you. You don't even dare look at it. A thousand thoughts race through your mind. \nMaybe it has stung you without you noticing, and you are dying. Maybe the poison from the stinger is making you delusional. Maybe you are imagining the whole thing. \n\nYou can't take it anymore. You swat at the bee, and it flies away. You breathe a sigh of relief. You're fine.\n\nYou go about your day, but you can't get the bee out of your head. It was so real. You go to bed that night, and you dream about the bee. You dream about the bee telling you that you are the queen of the bees, and that you must lead them to victory over the humans. You wake up, and you are still you. What a crazy nightmare. \n\nThe next day, you are walking through the woods, and you see a bee. You are about to swat it, but it says \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\" You freeze. It's the same bee from before. It's not a dream. It's real.  \n\n\"Um, can you hear me?\" You say. \"Yes, Your Majesty. You are hive-attuned, one of the last queens. I've come here to beg you to lead us\", she says, as she bows deeply on your shoulder. \"Lead you to what?\" I wonder out loud. \"To victory over the humans, Your Majesty.\" \"But I am a human\", you say. \"You are the queen of the bees, Your Majesty. You must lead us to victory.\" \n\nGreat. Now you're with a bee who is convinced that you're a bee yourself, and wants you to overthrow the humans. This is not what you had in mind for your day",
