I then handed him the mug and told him that I loved him. It was always easy to please my father, he was a man with simple taste. My father looked at the mug with a giant smile and hugged me once more. \"I love it\", he said to me and poured himself some hot coffee in his new mug.

I did not know what he meant, so I looked at the mug, and to my shock, the mug no longer said \"#1 Dad\". The mug now said \"#25th Dad\". My father asked if it was some cruel joke.

My father was a strong, gentle man, who had always sacrificed so much with my mother, to make sure we had everything we needed growing up. I woke up early that morning because I was so excited that I could not sleep. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning waiting to open presents. I heard my father get up to have his breakfast in the kitchen like he usually did every morning. I ran into the kitchen and said \"Happy Father's Day dad\", and gave him a hug. I then handed him the mug and told him that I loved him. It was always easy to please my father, he was a man with simple taste. My father looked at the mug with a giant smile and hugged me once more. \"I love it\", he said to me and poured himself some hot coffee in his new mug. I sat down at the table with him to have breakfast. We had cereal together and when my mother got up to have breakfast, she made pancakes. We all sat down together at the table to celebrate my father. Suddenly, my father's expression changed into one of happiness to confusion. I asked what was wrong and he said, \"the mug has changed\". I did not know what he meant, so I looked at the mug, and to my shock, the mug no longer said \"#1 Dad\". The mug now said \"#25th Dad\". My father asked if it was some cruel joke. How could the mug just change on its own? Someone must have played a prank on me from the store where I bought the mug.   I told my father that I did not know what happened and that I would go back to the store to get a new mug. He said it was okay and that I did not have to. He became very sad and left the table. I felt awful and wondered how I could make it right. I went to the store and asked the clerk if there was anything that could be done. The clerk looked at the mug and nothing had changed, it still said \"#1 Dad\". I explained that it had changed back at home and he did not believe me. He sent me away and said I was crazy. When I returned home, my father said he would do everything in his power to become the best dad ever. He started to work harder at his job and he came home earlier every day. He spent more and more time with me and my mother. He took us shopping and to special events in our community. He even started to cook dinner every night. He also read many books on how to become a better father. It was a happy moment for us all because he was spending a lot of time with us, but it was also saddening because he felt unworthy of being a great father.

I even had the mug engraved with his name because I felt it added an extra touch of love. My father was a strong, gentle man, who had always sacrificed so much with my mother, to make sure we had everything we needed growing up. I woke up early that morning because I was so excited that I could not sleep. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning waiting to open presents. I heard my father get up to have his breakfast in the kitchen like he usually did every morning. I ran into the kitchen and said \"Happy Father's Day dad\", and gave him a hug. I then handed him the mug and told him that I loved him. It was always easy to please my father, he was a man with simple taste. My father looked at the mug with a giant smile and hugged me once more. \"I love it\", he said to me and poured himself some hot coffee in his new mug. I sat down at the table with him to have breakfast. We had cereal together and when my mother got up to have breakfast, she made pancakes. We all sat down together at the table to celebrate my father. Suddenly, my father's expression changed into one of happiness to confusion. I asked what was wrong and he said, \"the mug has changed\". I did not know what he meant, so I looked at the mug, and to my shock, the mug no longer said \"#1 Dad\". The mug now said \"#25th Dad\". My father asked if it was some cruel joke. How could the mug just change on its own? Someone must have played a prank on me from the store where I bought the mug.   I told my father that I did not know what happened and that I would go back to the store to get a new mug. He said it was okay and that I did not have to. He became very sad and left the table. I felt awful and wondered how I could make it right. I went to the store and asked the clerk if there was anything that could be done. The clerk looked at the mug and nothing had changed, it still said \"#1 Dad\". I explained that it had changed back at home and he did not believe me. He sent me away and said I was crazy. When I returned home, my father said he would do everything in his power to become the best dad ever. He started to work harder at his job and he came home earlier every day. He spent more and more time with me and my mother. He took us shopping and to special events in our community. He even started to cook dinner every night. He also read many books on how to become a better father. It was a happy moment for us all because he was spending a lot of time with us, but it was also saddening because he felt unworthy of being a great father. None of it was true, he was the best dad in the world to me. I knew it, and my mother did as well, but he did not. He became sad and depressed because he was using so much of his time and energy into becoming the best dad. He had no time to spend with his friends and he even started to lose his hair. He stopped going to work and had turned his back on his faith, his church. He had become a different man and a different person. He was no longer the father I knew and loved. I felt like I was losing my father slowly, but surely. My mother and I felt guilty for not seeing his downfall sooner. We felt that we had taken him for granted. ",

He had always been there for my family and we loved him for that. He was a great father and I did not need a mug to tell me that. He looked at me and the sadness lifted from his face, his being, his essence. ",

I even had the mug engraved with his name because I felt it added an extra touch of love. My father was a strong, gentle man, who had always sacrificed so much with my mother, to make sure we had everything we needed growing up. I woke up early that morning because I was so excited that I could not sleep. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning waiting to open presents. I heard my father get up to have his breakfast in the kitchen like he usually did every morning. I ran into the kitchen and said \"Happy Father's Day dad\", and gave him a hug. I then handed him the mug and told him that I loved him. It was always easy to please my father, he was a man with simple taste. My father looked at the mug with a giant smile and hugged me once more. \"I love it\", he said to me and poured himself some hot coffee in his new mug. I sat down at the table with him to have breakfast. We had cereal together and when my mother got up to have breakfast, she made pancakes. We all sat down together at the table to celebrate my father. Suddenly, my father's expression changed into one of happiness to confusion. I asked what was wrong and he said, \"the mug has changed\". I did not know what he meant, so I looked at the mug, and to my shock, the mug no longer said \"#1 Dad\". The mug now said \"#25th Dad\". My father asked if it was some cruel joke. How could the mug just change on its own? Someone must have played a prank on me from the store where I bought the mug.   I told my father that I did not know what happened and that I would go back to the store to get a new mug. He said it was okay and that I did not have to. He became very sad and left the table. I felt awful and wondered how I could make it right. I went to the store and asked the clerk if there was anything that could be done. The clerk looked at the mug and nothing had changed, it still said \"#1 Dad\". I explained that it had changed back at home and he did not believe me. He sent me away and said I was crazy. When I returned home, my father said he would do everything in his power to become the best dad ever. He started to work harder at his job and he came home earlier every day. He spent more and more time with me and my mother. He took us shopping and to special events in our community. He even started to cook dinner every night. He also read many books on how to become a better father. It was a happy moment for us all because he was spending a lot of time with us, but it was also saddening because he felt unworthy of being a great father. None of it was true, he was the best dad in the world to me. I knew it, and my mother did as well, but he did not. He became sad and depressed because he was using so much of his time and energy into becoming the best dad. He had no time to spend with his friends and he even started to lose his hair. He stopped going to work and had turned his back on his faith, his church. He had become a different man and a different person. He was no longer the father I knew and loved. I felt like I was losing my father slowly, but surely. My mother and I felt guilty for not seeing his downfall sooner. We felt that we had taken him for granted. We felt that we should have seen the signs and done something about it. I realized that my father was the best dad because he had spent so much time with us, after the mug changed in front of his eyes.
