Spurred on, that Liz thinks she needs help as much as he does, Clive strides into the auditorium with renewed purpose.  He takes a seat near the front, and prepares to have his life changed.\n\nThe lecture drones on, and Clive is about ready to lose his mind. He hasn't really heard anything that is of much help. Be open, be real, be honest.  Blah, blah, blah.  All things he really can't be since he is a shapeshifter and is afraid to tell Liz who he really is.  At the lunch break, discouraged, Clive goes to the fountain outside the building to contemplate his situation. He loves Liz so much, and though he has tried to break free from his passion for her, something about her draws him back.\n\nClive hears some muffled sobbing coming from the other side of a tree. Intrigued by who could possibly feel as badly as he does, he gets up and walks towards the sound. Of all the things, there sits Liz. Clive is in shock, and his heart is wrenching that the love of his life is in pain. He goes up to her and quietly sits down and asks, \"Can I help you?\" In tears and a pained voice, Liz answers, \"I came here to find out how to be better so I could really find true love. But all the classes are about being yourself.\" Liz looks at Clive with fear and hesitation, and states, \"I can't really do that because, you see, I am a shapeshifter.\" She looks at him expectantly. Clive bursts out laughing and hollers \"SO AM I!\" Thrilled that they have found someone similar to themselves, they lock hands and walk off together. Maybe the class was a good idea after all.\n\n",
