Along with Ally's Russia, Canada, and Africa, will the USA be able to defind itself and the other nations from being taken over by Chiang Kai-Shek? The war is a relatively short one as the countries had been preparing for this moment for over fifty years. This was the most lethal war in history as Chiang Kai-Shek immediately started dropping bombs on the USA and its ally countries. If not for russia, China would have been able to do much more damage than it had previously done. Russia stormed their country and prevented the attacks long enough for the USA to fight back and send troops into the country. The USA, Canada, Russia, and Africa fought back with all they force they could come up with, and knocked off Chiang Kai-Shek once and for all. The war showed that you can not really ever truly trust other nations, and it increased the use of espionage greatly. This event marked an important point in history.\n",
