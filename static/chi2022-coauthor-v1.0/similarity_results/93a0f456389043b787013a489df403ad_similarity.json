They have an economy that is booming, phenomenal foreign policy and even universal healthcare.\n\nNow you may be asking yourself why other countries can't become this neutral power. The answer is simple, other countries don't have the resources that the United States have. Some countries simply have to fight with others simply to survive. They need the medicine, the resources and the land that other countries inhabit. \n\nThe United States also has another advantage over these other countries. The United States is known worldwide as the only true superpower left. No other country is going to want to get into a conflict where they are most likely going to lose. Other countries don't have the power, weapons or technology to overtake the United States. \n\nNow the United States could be a bully and try and take advantage of their advantageous position in the world. \n\nInstead they finally have realized that not getting involved in other countries business is the key to them prospering as a country. A lesson that took a while to learn, but was the most worthwhile one they could have learned.",
