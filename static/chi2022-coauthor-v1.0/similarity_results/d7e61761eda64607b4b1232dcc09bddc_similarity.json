He tells Sara that he has lived many centuries searching for the right woman. Like a vampire that is immortal. He can only move on and grow old when he finds the woman of his dreams. And she truly loves him in return. Poc tells Sara everything. That he has been infatuated with her for years. That all of the 'losers' she dated in the past, were really him.  Sara is stunned into silence. She begins to cry and turns away.\n\nPoc is heartbroken. He sits in silence and in pain. He feels like his heart is being torn out of his chest. Sara turns to him. There is forgiveness in her eyes. She tells him that she understands. She know that it took great courage for Poc to tell her all of this, and that is the one thing that has been missing in all her relationships. Someone truthful and courageous. Poc is so relieved he wants to jump for joy. Hiding his real self all this time has been what has kept Sara from really loving him.",
