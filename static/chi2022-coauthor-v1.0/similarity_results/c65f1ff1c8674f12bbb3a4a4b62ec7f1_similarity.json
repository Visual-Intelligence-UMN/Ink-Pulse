And he was closest to his home at the time. So off he went for the short walk to his house in the small neighborhood just outside of the city.\n\nComing back to his house, Bob was confused as to why he was supposed to come here. Everything looked the same and he didn't know what to do to get back to the present time.  All Bob wanted to do was get his sunglasses and it has turned into a daylong adventure!  \n\nBob began to walk from room to room in his house to search for a clue on how to get back to the present time. As he walked through the kitchen, he noticed a strange looking plant.  Bob didn't own any plants so he thought it was odd that it was there.  It was the only thing out of place.  \n\n\"I don't know why but I think that plant has something to do with me getting back to the present time,\" Bob thought. He began to inspect the plant further.  It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump and round, and smelled delicious.  ",
