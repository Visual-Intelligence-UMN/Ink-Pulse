They claim my group are just squatters and that we've taken more than our share.\n\nA fight ends up developing. It's quite a sight to see. People are falling and breaking their hips. Others are just sitting down to catch their breath. This ends up catching the attention of the zombies who are on the mainland. Many gather, watching in amusement. \n\nMy group and the other seniors make an uneasy truce. We'll live together on the island and just avoid each other. We realize we don't have much time left to live anyway so we may as well not spend our last days fighting. The zombies would enjoy watching it too much. ",
