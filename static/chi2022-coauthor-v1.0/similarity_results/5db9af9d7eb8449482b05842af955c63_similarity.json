For example, the reincarnation of me that fought in WWI was missing an arm from the war, and the me that lived in the 50's actually died around the age of 25 in a car crash. The me that lived in the early 1900's was actually a professional and olympic athlete. The common theme was that all of the people looking similar to me were athletic, the uncommon theme were the accents of speech, the personalities, and the life experiences.\n\nAll i wanted to do was sit down and ask everyone about their lives to compare and contrast experiences but it was too late.

I asked everyone what was going on, and i heard a voice similar to mine respond that this was the reincarnation of us.
