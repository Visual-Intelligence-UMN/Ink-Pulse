But the important thing to walk away with from this contemplation and reflection is that no one is perfect. No one who watches the movie of their life will ever feel that the events in their life unfolded absolutely perfectly. \n\nSo if you are feeling a bit down about yourself and your life, it is important to remember that you are not alone. Don't feel that you have let yourself down or let others down. Also remember that any mistakes or flaws in the movie will be magnified. So don't beat yourself up about it.\n\nIn conclusion, take this opportunity to view the movie of your life as one that is valuable to understand yourself and to understand the world around you. \n\nThis movie is a gift that you will be given when you die. Make sure to use the time that you are given with this gift in a way that is meaningful. This means that you should live your life in the present and make amends with people you hurt as soon as you can, before you reach the end of your life. ",
