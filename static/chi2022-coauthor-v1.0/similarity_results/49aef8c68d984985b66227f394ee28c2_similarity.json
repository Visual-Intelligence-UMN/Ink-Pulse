The bees all carried me up and took me to this gigantic bee hive. They put me in a room and said \"Your Majesty, this is your room. You may go outside and explore the hive if you wish.\" I looked at the bees and said \"I want to go home.\" \"This is not my home.\" The bees looked at me and said \"Your Majesty, this is your home now. You are the Queen of the Bees.\" \"What do you wish for?\" asked the bee. Can i get some food maybe? I asked. The bees looked at me and said \"Your Majesty, we have prepared a feast for you.",

I looked around and noticed that no one else was paying any attention to me. Can you first tell me what the heck is going on right now? I asked the Bee.
