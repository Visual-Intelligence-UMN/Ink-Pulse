When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. \n\nThe city of Atlanta has become a battleground for the survival of the human race. Obtaining Mana is the only way to ensure the survival of the people. Now, three young students discover a secret that may change everything... They discover the Mana Cave. \n\nThe Mana Cave is the original source of all Mana.

The Mana Cave is the key to victory. \n\nThe cave is protected by a magical seal that only allows people of the purest hearts and truest intentions to enter. Many have fallen by trying to enter the cave. And those who have made it inside have never returned. No one knows just how much Mana is inside because no one exits the cave once inside.

But they quickly discover that the cave is more than what it seems. Right from the beginning, it seemed like forces of nature were playing with them. But once they enter the cave, things change. Walls seemed to change shape, and lights would appear and then disappear. Soon they find themselves in a mysterious place and realize they are not alone. They heard voices telling them where to go. They didn't know if they should trust the voices, but they had no other choice. They were lost. \n\nThe friends find themselves at a place known as the Throne Room. The throne in the middle of the room is empty. But then, the throne begins to shake and a light fills the room. From the light comes a loud, booming voice. It said, \"I am the guardian of this cave.
