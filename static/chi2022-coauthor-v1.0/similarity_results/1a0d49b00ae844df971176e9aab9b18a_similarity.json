        "sentence": "When you're 28, science discovers a drug that stops all effects of aging, creating immortality. Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations\" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.\n\nThe elderly had their time in Washington protesting for around a year. They were met with violence and were eventually forced to leave the capital. Not that they wanted to be there in the first place. The drug that was affecting people at over 85 has a one side effect, well, despite the fact that they would be immortal looking how they look at the age of 85 and not at the age of 28.\n\nThe side effect is this: If you're over 85 years old, you will turn into a zombie. And worse, all the elderly who took the drug have now turned into zombies and infecting people they bite. The protesters have a safe haven in Washington, where no reported zombies in the area. \n\nIt was too late though. More than half of the population of the United States have turned into zombies. Only parts of the Northeast are safe. The government seem to have given up on the fight and are just trying to keep the remaining population alive. Even if the young and the powerful are now immortal, they are still susceptible to the zombies. One of the scientists who created the drug is trying to find a cure.\n\nThe year is now 2029.

We're going to get through this.",
