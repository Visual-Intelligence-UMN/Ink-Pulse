Why don't I just show you?\" The alien took out a second taco and ate it in one bite. \"Here, watch this,\" said the alien. Matt Damon wasn't sure what happened next or how the alien did it, but a moment later he was standing in a Taco Bell drive-thru line. The Taco Bell was hovering in the sky, surrounded by stars. \"That's so cool!\" said Matt Damon. He looked around him, amazing by what he was seeing.
