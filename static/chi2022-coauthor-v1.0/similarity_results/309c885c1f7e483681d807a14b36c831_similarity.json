The mug is so powerful that it will destroy the whole earth if it's put in the wrong hands. The night before Father's Day, something terrible happens. Someone breaks into the vault and steals the mug! The person that stole the mug is unaware of its special powers. They take the mug with them and use it to drink their morning coffee.\n\nThat morning there is a press conference. The police announce that the mug has been stolen and that the thief must be stopped before it's too late. One reporter raises their hand to ask a question. \"I heard that the mug has special powers.

Anyone that drinks from this mug can easily...um...impregnate any woman in a 5-yard radius.\" \n\nAll of the reporters start yelling, \"What! Why on earth would anyone make a mug like that?\" \n\nThe officer responded. \"Well you see, it was for someone in particular that wasn't able to have kids of their own.
