As our world grew, our magical powers began to wither away. The mana pool, where humanity gained its magical powers from, was not sufficient enough to sustain the population on our planet as it grew beyond 7 billion.

Most of our magical powers were mere shadows of what they used to be. The supply of mana could not power our magical ambitions.

The alien invaders enslaved humanity and killed countless others on their conquest of our planet. As the human population decreased, the mana pool began to have a greater effect on our powers once more. The remaining humans began to band together in small communities, and used their powers for the betterment of humanity.

We knew the best time to attack is when they are at their weakest, in the middle of a new moon. The new moon weakened their bodies to a point of hibernation, which was the perfect window of attack. We had to strike now, before they were fully prepared for the new moon. On the dawn of the new moon, our mole and a few of our soldiers planted an explosive, magic bomb at the alien mana source. They managed to escape before the explosion. The explosion was loud and bright. The aliens were weak and feeble without their source of mana. We began our attack by sending in our soldiers, wiping out the aliens quickly. Our soldiers were armed with magic guns, which harnessed our newly found powers. The fighting progressed throughout the night, with humanity gaining more and more victories. The aliens became desperate and began to use their most powerful weapons. The weapons were no match for our magical powers, proving to have no effect on us. Our soldiers were able to subdue the remaining aliens with ease.
