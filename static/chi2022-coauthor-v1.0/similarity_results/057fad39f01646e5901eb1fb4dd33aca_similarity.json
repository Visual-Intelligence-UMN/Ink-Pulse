He wondered if JFK contacted him from the dead or if someone was playing a trick. He thought about it for a few minutes and decided to call the number. It rang and then a man answered. \"Hello,\" said the man on the other line. \"This is John F. Kennedy.\" Obama didn't believe it. \"No way,\" he said. But the man on the other line said, \"Look out your window.\" \nSo Barack looked out the window and saw JFK standing outside. \"Are you a ghost?\" asked Barack. \"No,\" said JFK. But there was no time for talking about that. JFK had to get to the real mission at hand. \"I need you to come with me to the future,\" he said. \n\"Okay, I'm retired so I may as well,\" said Barack. And then he met JFK outside where there was a time machine. It was a DeLorean just like in Back to the Future. So he gets in and they take off. \"Where are we going?\" asked Barack. \"To the year 2040,\" said JFK. \n\"And why are we going there?\" he asked. JFK told him it was because the world was in danger.
