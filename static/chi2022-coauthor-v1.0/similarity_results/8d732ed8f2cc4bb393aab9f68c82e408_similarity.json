Pig knew this, but simply could not trust him because he never knew when he would snap. Wolf grew lonely as the days went on, and he felt this home would bring him more friends and more happy times. The security was nice, but the friends were nicer. The wolf could not get the house out of his mind, and although he did not know exactly how to make the home, he tried his best. Voila! The wolf had built a home that looked identical to the pigs. The pig was impressed. But the pig knew it was not the same home. The pig blew to see how sturdy it truly was. He called on his brothers and twenty other pigs came by. They all blew, and the wolves house went down. The wolf looked devastated. \"Im going to have to try harder\" said the wolf. \"Sorry.\" said the pig. But the house is only identical if it can withstand the blow of 92 pigs. The wolf understood, and began working once again. Will the wolf be able to complete the home or will this be the sequal to the three little pigs, only reversed and with 92 pigs instead.",
