The wolf said, \"I am sorry I burned your house down, I will make it up to you.\" The pig said, \"okay, how?\" The wolf said, \"I will build you a new house.\" The pig said, \"okay, but what kind of house will you build me?\" The wolf said, \"I will build you a house made from bricks.\" The pig said, \"okay, but what kind of bricks will you use?\" The wolf said, \"I will use the best bricks there are, the ones made from gold.\" The pig said, \"okay, but what kind of gold will you use?\" The wolf said, \"I will use the best gold there is, the kind that is mined from the ground.\" The pig said, \"okay, but what kind of ground will you mine it from?\" The wolf said, \"I will mine it from the ground that is made from uranium.\" When the pig heard uranium he got super excited because then he would have the same house that was burned to the ground that he worked so hard to build . So the wolf and the pig went to the uranium mine and the wolf started to mine the uranium and the pig started to build his house. The wolf was very happy because he knew the pig was going to have a great house and he was going to get the uranium that he wanted. It took the wolf 19 days to build the house but when the house was finished it was the most beautiful house in the area and even more beautiful than the one the pig had built before. The pig was very happy and thanked the wolf endlessly .",
