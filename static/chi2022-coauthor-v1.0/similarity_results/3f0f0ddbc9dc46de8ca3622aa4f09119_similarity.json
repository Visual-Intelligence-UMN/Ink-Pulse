        "sentence": "An alien has kidnapped Matt Damon, not knowing what lengths humanity goes through to retrieve him whenever he goes missing.\n\nThe alien has been watching the Bourne movies and has decided that he wants to be Jason Bourne. What the alien doesn't understand is that Jason Bourne is a fictional character. Matt Damon isn't actually Jason Bourne, he just plays the character in the movies. The alien has to find a way to communicate with Matt Damon.\n\nMatt Damon speaks English and the alien obviously doesn't. Luckily, the aliens have a translation device that can translate any language into their own alien language. Damon explains to the alien that Jason Bourne isn't a real person. He is just an actor. The alien understands and makes Matt Damon a deal.\n\nThe alien explains that if Matt Damon can get him in his own Jason Bourne movie, he will return Damon to Earth. The alien wants to live as Jason Bourne and the only way that can be accomplished is if the alien takes over the role that Matt Damon has been playing. \n\nMatt tells the alien that he will see what he can do and makes a call to the director of the Bourne series. Damon explains that his life is on the line and he really needs a favor. The director says that he'll do anything for Matt and tells him they can do a remake of the original Bourne Identity starring the alien.\n\nMatt explains the deal to the alien and the alien agrees. The alien is sent to Earth and funnily enough he has the entire script memorized. These are the only English words that he can say, even if he doesn't understand all of them. To the directors surprise, the alien is a natural when it comes to acting.\n\nMatt Damon is returned to Earth and is reunited with his family. The movie is also a box office hit and makes millions of dollars. The alien really was a natural. \n\nThe alien left to go back to his home planet but he left a gift behind as a way to apologize and also thank Matt Damon. Matt Damon goes into his backyard and he sees a giant tarp with a note on it.\n\nThe tarp reads \"Thanks for making my dream come true Matt, sorry for abducting you!\" Damon took the tarp off and a UFO was revealed. Damon became the first human on the planet to own a UFO and has the ability to go to space whenever he wants. ",
