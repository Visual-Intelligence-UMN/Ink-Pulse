So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.\n\nThe 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, \"dude, this is a really good house, man.\" Instead of trying to blow the house down the wolf decided to try and build a house of his own like that. \"Any uranium left my friend?\" asked the wolf. \"Im not sure. I think i may have gotten the last of it wolfie\". Said the pig. At that remark the wolf was upset. How was he suppose to get a house like the little pig's if there was no uranium left. Is the little pig going to have the nicest house in the village just out of luck? In that instance the wolf headed back to his home.\n\n\"I dont know if i can trust that other wolf\" thought the pig. The pig knew how special its home was, and there was no way that the wolf was going to be able to replicate what he has done with his home. You see, the little pig has built other homes before and knows exactly what it takes to build the perfect home. It was not just the first three little pigs who could build a home. The 92nd little pig was actually the most talented of all when it came to building, and it was this talent that the pig hoped would bring its mother back to see him. This home appeared on magazines and blurbs, but still his mother was nowhere to be found. \n\nThe next day there was another knock on the door. The little pig stood up to check who it was. It looked like the wolf, along with a couple of other wolves. The pig opened the door. \"Would you mind signing our petition to allow for wolves to have kids here. The county is not allowing for it and it troubles our heart.\" The pig thought this was a good cause so signed without hesitation. \"I am sorry to hear about this wolves. I hope this signature helps!\" The wolves scamper off. That night, another group of wolves come to the house with suitcases. \"Hello little pig! I am afraid your time is up here! That paper you signed was actually the rights to your home, which we own now\" The pig was mortified. Could this be true? The little pig never learned how to read and did not know that something like this was even possible. Just like that, the wolves came in and left the little pig homeless.",
