Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\" You think on that, as though asking yourself to instruct yourself... You're not really afraid of bees, but the allergy thing is dangerous. \n\nYou decide to take a chance. You brush at the bee to get it off. It comes right back, buzzing louder, angrier. Guess that wasn't the right decision! You don't care; you try to brush it off again. You feel a prick on your thumb, the bee bumps your hand again and falls to the ground. It stung you! You're not sure why, but you're not afraid. It does hurt, throbbing a bit, swollen a tiny amount. You head back home to see if you should go to the hospital. \n\nYou get home, and your mother is there. You show her and she's worried, but calm in the same way you've been. She tells you she'll drive you to the hospital since it might cause problems. You get in the car, and she drives you there. You don't think you're worried, but you are a little nervous now that you're honest with yourself. \n\nThe thumb is swelling up fast! You feel like taking a nap as you get to the hospital, but you're breathing is tight - it takes too much effort. You're feeling a little sick. You figure everything will be taken care of, I might pass out but I just need to breathe, one breath at a time... \n\nYou wake up in a hospital bed, your mother is there. She smiles and asks how you feel. You feel tired, but can't remember getting out of the car! You feel relief as the doctor tells you you're fine. The swelling is gone, and you're breathing normally.",
