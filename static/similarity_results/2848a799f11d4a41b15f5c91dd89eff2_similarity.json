        "sentence": "Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations\" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.\n\nThe young people long ago were once glad they got to take this drug that made them immortal. However, over time, they also became evil. They were so used to being immortal that they became selfish and greedy. We never knew if the drug caused the greed or if they just became that way because they weren't afraid of dying. It didn't matter. The greed and selfishness of the young people caused them to take over the world. I was 85, and other people my age were locked in group homes and never allowed to leave. We were the only ones who remembered what it was like before the young people took over. The oldest of the \"young\" used to remember but they put us all away so they could forget.\nOne day a small group of us, me and 4 others, decided to plot our escape. We were tired of being locked up. So one evening when everyone else was asleep, I broke a large window, and the 5 of us escaped. An alarm went off, but we stole a car and were miles down the road before any of the guards noticed. We drove for days, and when we were sure we were safe, we stopped at a small town to rest. We stopped at a motel but we hadn't thought of how we would get around without getting caught. As the 5 of us were brainstorming in the car we were startled by a knock at the window. It was another \"Lost Generation\" member! I could tell by the gray hair on her head. She welcomed us inside. \"You're home,\" she told us as we sat down in the lobby chairs with here. We were each given a new immortality drug that the young didn't know about. It turns out we landed in a town filled with the \"lost\" who had all escaped like we did. With this drug created by one of the Lost we were also able to live forever. Not as young people, but just as we were. And this is where it ends. We are safe here now in this community. The young greedy ones stay on their side and we ours. And we like it that way.",
