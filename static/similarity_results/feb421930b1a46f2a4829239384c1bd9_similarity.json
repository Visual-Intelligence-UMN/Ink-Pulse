When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.\n\nI'm not sure where I stand on the idea of immortality. Immortality seems like a really cool idea and all but sometimes you just don't want to live anymore. I mean, think about it, if people don't die, then what's the point of living forever?. And also, people would get pretty bored just sitting around, and then they probably would just go crazy. \n\nYeah, maybe it's ok if you need to see someone for one last time knowing you're not going to die but knowing that you're not going to die and knowing that you'll never die is just too much.\n\nOn the bright side, the benefits of not dying would include being able to do things you've never done before such as travel to places you've never been or go swimming on the ocean floor for the first time. You can do A LOT of things if you never die. You could visit every single continent if you wanted, and you'll be able to experience a lot of things for the first time.\n\nSo there are some benefits to not dying but let's be real most people would want to die at some point. I mean what else is there to do if you've already traveled the world, swam up the highest mountain, and gone into space. What are you living for if you've already done everything.\n\nI am glad I got to experience swimming up mountains and going to space but that's where the fun ends, hopefully, they can undo this immortality side effect somehow as I don't want to live forever.",
