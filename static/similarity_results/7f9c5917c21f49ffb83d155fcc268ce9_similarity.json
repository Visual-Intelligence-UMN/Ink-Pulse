        "sentence": "Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the â€œLost Generations\" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. It turns out that after a few decades the minds of those who have taken the drug begin slowly regressing to a childlike state. This regression doesn't happen at the same speed as a child's mental development only in reverse, it's a much slower process. However, slowly but surely, all the young people are becoming more childlike in their thinking and behavior. There is a panic and the government is at a loss as to how to deal with this unprecedented crisis. The government decides to take the drug away from the young people, but this only makes the problem worse. The side effects seem to be permanent and when people stop taking the drug they only proceed at a faster pace. Soon some of the people who had taken the drug are in an infantile state unable to care for themselves. The government decides to put them in a special facility. People are required to work as caretakers for these unnatural babies but many of those who weren't allowed the drug are too old now to take on that responsibility. The government decides to hire young people to do the job. It's a strange situation but there are no alternatives. The facilities are now filled with grown babies being cared for by children who, one day, will grow old enough to be suited for this bizarre work.",
