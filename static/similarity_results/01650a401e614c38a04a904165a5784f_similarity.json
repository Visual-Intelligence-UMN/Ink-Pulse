        "sentence": "Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations\" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.\n\n\n\nIn the year 2045, the world is a very different place. The population has exploded to the point where there is no more room on Earth. Having immortality is good, but with nobody ever dying, natural resources have grown scarce.  There is little food, and the rich own all of the land. \n\nThe rich have moved to the moon, and the rest of the population has been left to fend for themselves. The only way to get to the moon is to win a lottery. The lottery is held every year, and the odds of winning are one in a million. \n\nYou have retired to a small cabin in the wilderness, illegally located in a rich trillionaire's hunting reserve.   You live off the land, and you have a small garden. \n\nOne day, you discover that the rich are hunting humans. The immortality drug has secretly contained tracers, so the rich can hunt those who take it, for their cannibalistic rituals.  You feel sick to your stomach. You must survive the hunters, and the other dangers of the wilderness.  You must also find a way to get to the moon, and win the lottery, to cure this evil at its source. \n\nYou have your work cut out for you! You have outlived all of your friends, and have nothing to lose. This will be your last hurrah!",
