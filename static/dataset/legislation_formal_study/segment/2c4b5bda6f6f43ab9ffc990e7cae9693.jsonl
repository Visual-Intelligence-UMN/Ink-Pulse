While corporate personhood had negative implications within campaign finance because it allowed corporations to have unlimited power and influence in elections, the application of corporate personhood to the types of lawsuits corporations can enter into is typically seen as a positive effect, because it provides consumers a way to hold corporations accountable in court, balancing the scales of justice.\n\nCorporate personhood lets companies own patents and trademarks, enhancing their legal protections and competitive edge.
