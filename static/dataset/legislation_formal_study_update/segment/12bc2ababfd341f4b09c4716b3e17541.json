The risk of misinformation, and its associated costs, must be mitigated by future antitrust legislation.\nExisting legislation, designed for markets with costs extending not far past monetary ones, lack the scope and capabilities of dealing with zero-price markets. Consumer welfare and market efficiency are being affected by an increasing number of novel factors, and at an even greater scale as even lesser-developed countries are readily able to access the internet. These concerns have already begun to realize themselves through large scale data breaches and widespread misinformation. As these problems grow in magnitude and in reach, regulators must be prepared to combat these.\n",
