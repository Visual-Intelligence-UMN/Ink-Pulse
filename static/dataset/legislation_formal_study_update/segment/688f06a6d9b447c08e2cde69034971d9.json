Corporate personhood is the legal status that allows companies and businesses to sue, be sued, and own property like individuals do. \n\nCorporate personhood lets companies contribute to political campaigns, influencing elections like real people do. Corporations use funds to support candidates, shaping policies that benefit their interests in elections. However, this has raised much discussion on the potential risks and corruption that may be associated with this freedom. For example, a big oil company may lobby against environmental regulations to protect profits, impacting climate policy decisions. This power can overshadow individual voices, raising concerns about democracy and who really holds influence. This may also ultimately cause an imbalance leading to corporations prioritizing profits over people’s needs and societal well-being. \n\nYet, corporate personhood has widely been deemed as necessary and beneficial for the business world. Corporate personhood helps protect investors by limiting personal liability for business debts and risks. It also encourages innovation by allowing companies to attract investment without risking personal assets like money, property and valuables that can be affected by debt.\n\nHowever, we must balance corporate rights with the public's need for transparency and ethical behavior in business practices. Corporate personhood complicates the relationship between ethics and profit, making businesses navigate moral responsibilities carefully. Will businesses ever become more powerful than the individual? \n\n\n",
