Additionally, there is the fear that consumer data such as personal information and browsing habits are being sold to third parties, without the consent of the consumer. In response, Google and Facebook lawyers claim that their free services actually improve the welfare of consumers and advertisers by promoting innovation. Concerning data, Google and Facebook claim that while they do transfer data to advertisers, it is anonymous, and that they care about protecting user privacy. Europe is also going through a similar situation, however the EU has already enacted policies that constrict zero price markets. The Digital Services Act, passed in 2022, enforces transparency and seeks to protect user data, whereas the cases in America are still pending. The public largely is on the side of the prosecution in these arguments, at least as it pertains to their data. While the free digital experiences are certainly very useful, many are worried about their data being sold. In response to this, many people are quitting social media, or using alternative search engines other than Google. For instance, DuckDuckGo is a popular search engine that emphasizes that your search habits are not tracked. It will be interesting to see how these antitrust cases continue to develop over the next few years. Clearly, companies like Facebook and Google hold a lot of power, and their services provide a lot of utility to their customers, so it is hard to clearly see where the harm lies. But in a world where so much of a person's data is online, it would perhaps be prudent for American policymakers to consider other tech policies enacted around the world in order to create a much safer digital experience for its citizens. \n\n\n",
