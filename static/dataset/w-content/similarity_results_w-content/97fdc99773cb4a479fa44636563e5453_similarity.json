What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, if a university or college is profiting off of a student athlete, the student athlete should be paid monetarily and not via scholarship. A student athlete getting paid would not the economy of universities. The amount that these schools make off of the student athletes is incredible. We're talking about millions and in some case billions of dollars and the student athletes don't see a cent of that. \n\nI do understand the point that student athletes would become a bidding war for universities that have a lot of capital. I don't see that as any difference than free agency in sports. Typically the highest bidder will win but there are some cases where an athlete wants to be close to home or takes a hometown discount. At the very least, the student athlete should have to weigh those options.\n\nThe easy way to solve that issue as well is simply to limit the amount that a student athlete can make. $250,000 is a fantastic salary for a student athlete and is life changing money for any 18 to 22 year old. You can put a specific criteria on the salary such as maintaining a 2.0 GPA each semester or their salary is forfeited or at the very least a portion is. This allows there to be fair competition between the universities and a school like Alabama won't be able to simply outbid a school like Syracuse.\n\nStudent athletes are working as a full time athlete and a full time student. Shouldn't they be paid for their efforts? What happens if a student athlete gets both a academic and an athletic scholarship? That student is punished if they get a full ride for both categories. They are entitled to 2X the scholarship amount and instead just get one scholarship amount. \n\nThe business of college athletics has been a scam for way too long. Student athletes have been exploited by universities for far too long. You have coaches like Clemson's Dabo Swinney saying that student athletes shouldn't be paid and that he'd retire if they did. Well, a bill was passed that allows student athletes to get paid for their imagine and likeness. Did Swinney retire? Of course not. He makes upwards of 10 million dollars a year. Imagine that. A coach making 10 million dollars a year while his players make absolutely nothing.\n\nAgain, a scenario where most logical and reasonable people will look at and say \"that is unfair.\" The only people who will say that it's fair are the people that are making tons of money off of those student athletes. \n\nLuckily, more and more people who have power have seen this issue and have acted in the student's favor. I look forward to more laws and bills being passed that allows student athletes to get their fair share of money. \n",
