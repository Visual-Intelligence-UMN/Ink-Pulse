I have noticed with my 3 children, that they are no longer learning the basic things in life that we were taught. How to manage finances and type properly and simple life skills are no longer in use. Schools are so often only teaching to the test, so to speak, to achieve high scores on standardized testing and thus obtain funding. This is not only a disservice to the students, but to the rest of the population that will have to live with these young people in the real world. \n\nAside from basic life skills, like banking and computer literacy, I think students need to learn how to help others and give freely of their time. I see the youth today as a selfish group of people. They are so tuned into the celebrities and popularity because of social media, that they don't see how the world really is until they actually exist in it by themselves. I have heard recommendations that all students in college should have to do mandatory volunteer work prior to graduation, and I think this should be a requirement for high school students, as well. \n",

When our youth strive to be an influencer or look for an easy way to make money, they are missing out on who they really could be. I know that parents ultimately have the responsibility for raising compassionate and empathetic children. When kids are spending 7 plus hours a day over 200 days in a classroom, however, some of the responsibility needs to fall on the schools. \n\nObviously students need to continue to learn grammar and math and science. It is simply needed to have these classes so we aren't a completely ignorant nation. And to give groundwork to further education. However, teaching how to get along by yourself for simple adult tasks like banking and using a computer proficiently, would help these people to become self sufficient. Most students are graduating high school when they are 18, and these simple life skills are a need to survive in the world adequately.  On top of that, being a useful compassionate person who understands the importance of giving will enrich these children's lives and enrich the lives of those they have contact with after they are out of their sheltered school environment.\n\n",
