This way the athletes can make the rational decision whether to pursue that particular sport or not. My stance on the acceptability of extreme sports and whether they should be banned in some cases is to let them continue for now until more research is done. like with football and CTE, new information has emerged about the long term impact of playing full contact football and the extent of that damage. Its has encouraged early retirements across the league. I think MMA is about as extreme of a sport as there is. This one should be closely monitored for conditions like CTE and a whole host of other issues from getting hit in other places not just during their fights but during practice. It is literally their job to get beaten up. I would assume that we will see significant long term damage to these fighters, worse then what we see with older boxers. It is still their right to fight as long as it legally sanctioned. I cant stress this enough though, while I think extreme sports should be left up to the decisions of the athletes, I also think they should be given all the relevant data that goes along with their desired field. \n",
