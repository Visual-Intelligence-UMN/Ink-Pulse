I think students should just focus on learning about themselves. When i say this, i mean to try different things and try different classes. Go to different get togethers, put yourself out there. I think high school in particular is the perfect place to take risks. You are still with your parents so you have a support system, and you have all of these different clubs and organizations you can join and participate in. You have an opportunity to make closer friends and mingle with people, and being with others is one of the best ways to learn about yourself. \n",

You have an opportunity to make closer friends and mingle with people, and being with others is one of the best ways to learn about yourself. I think the most important thing i have learned in school is that i can do anything i set my mind to. I think anyone can do anything they set their mind to as long as they look at it the right way. If you do something everyday to contribute to your goal there is no way you can fail. Setting goals is so important, and high school is a great place to start. Whether you have athletic goals, or academic goals, a goal to get a boyfriend/girlfriend, a goal to be the leader of a club, etc. As long as you are doing something productive towards your goal, there is no way you fail. If you can shift your mind to take the positive out of any negative situation, it is a sure fire way to be happy in your life and learn from your mistakes. I think teenagers and kids in general need to take their mind and mental health so much more seriously, and learn how to control their thoughts and brain before their lives get to stressful. When you become an adult, there are so many more things you need to think about. If you dont know how to talk about your emotions and deal with them by the time you get older, it can be very difficult to do things like go after your goals or be helpful to other people. You need to help yourself before you can help others, and being aware of this as early as high school is a great way to continue to grow as a human. For me personally, knowing that i can achieve whatever goal i work at has impacted my life greatly. I am addicted to pursuing goals, and if i dont have one i feel empty. I played sports all my life, so that was something that always gave me a goal to work on. However, when i finished playing football in college, i realized that i needed to start and find goals outside of athletics. This led me to creating my own business and even getting into boxing, which yes is not outside of athletics, but is a huge challenge and mental challenge as well. To me, the main takeaway was simply to continue to take risks and improve myself. I realized that i need some sort of athletic in my life for its ability to calm my mind and body. Boxing was always something i wanted to get into but never had the chance since i played football year round. So in conclusion, i think the most important thing for someone to learn in school is simply themselves.\n",
