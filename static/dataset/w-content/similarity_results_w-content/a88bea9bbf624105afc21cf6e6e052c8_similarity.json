At the next town hall meeting, the pig brought this up.  He said he thought the wolf would stop blowing down houses if he were integrated into the community.  Pigs started to get to know the wolf and realized he wasn't a bad guy.  And, in return, the wolf didn't feel the need to destroy the pigs homes.  From then on, everyone lived in peace. The wolf even got into construction and helped build pig houses.\n",
