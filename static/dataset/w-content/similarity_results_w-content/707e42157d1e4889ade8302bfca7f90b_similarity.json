What I mean by this is they need to understand basic concepts which is fine but they need to be able to really understand the basics such as Scientific Method, which enables them to use this frame work to study things and evaluate information. Just because someone says something is true, for instance, doesn't mean it is. Critical thinking and scientific understanding hold up society and propel learning forward.\n\nBeing able to reason, understand facts, and make discoveries on their own are helped by these basis. Scientific method, Critical thinking, and independent thinking are excellent basis for all sorts of different lives. These include people who are scientists, political persons, Factory engineers, Computer programmers, and social scientists. Economics, math, and all sorts of reasoning need this basis, the basis of being able to reason, to work an equation, to figure and juxtapose different ideas onto different frameworks.\n",

It's important that they learn the basic building blocks of thought. Learning what is possible, what can be done if they try is helped by learning the scientific method. Ask why, ask Why not? Ask how. All questioning is good, answers are better. Learning things is a life long journey and young people should be armed with strong reasoning skills. The Scientific method of understanding how to test theory, how to prove processes is helpful here.\n\nSupport young people as they learn, ask and answer their questions. Support inquiry and help people when they have reasonable questions. Schools should support this. It's important and the way forward.\n",
