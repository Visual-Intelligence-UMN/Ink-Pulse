If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports. Also, I would predict that if college players were paid, then after a while, there would be a few schools with the really great teams because they can afford them and the rest would have less great teams. It could cause a scenario where the good (paid for) teams keep getting better while the schools less able to pay for their teams, would see a continued decline in the ability of their sports teams. \nIn conclusion i agree with the authors point that paying college athletes would ruin college sports. It would make it into something else completely;something that is good for neither college athletics, nor the schools themselves. \n",
