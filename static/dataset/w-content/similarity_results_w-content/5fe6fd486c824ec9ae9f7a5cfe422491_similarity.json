Your mother usually never let you outside or out of her sight, but today, she was out visiting a friend She had locked the bedroom door, but being a clever girl, you knew how to get out, into the forbidden outdoors. \n\nThen you feel the bee on your shoulder, its tiny feet clinging to the fabric of your shirt.

You can't believe your ears. \n\n\"I'm not the queen,\" you say, \"I'm just a girl.\" \n\"You are the queen, my Queen,\" the bee says, \"and I am your loyal servant.\" \"Your mother is dying, and sent me here to help you escape\" \n\n\"My mother is fine,\" you say, \"I just saw her. She was going to the market with a friend.\"  \"That is not your mother, My queen. That is a consort of wasps.\" The bee explains, \"They have taken over your mother's body and mind. Your true mother is in the woods near here, safe, with the rest of the honeybee hive!\" \n\n\"But I can't leave,\" you say, \"I'm allergic to bees.\" \"No\" The bee says. \n",
