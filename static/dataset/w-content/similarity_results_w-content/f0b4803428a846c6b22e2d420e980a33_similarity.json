However, they were much more willing to enter into a peace treaty to ensure there would not be a World War IV.  They also were enticed with hadronium.  They were very willing to make a deal.   All of the countries on earth signed the Anti-War Pact of 2300.  \n\nThis deal helped to secure the peace that followed for the next 300 years.  It was a time of progress and safety for humanity on earth.\n",
