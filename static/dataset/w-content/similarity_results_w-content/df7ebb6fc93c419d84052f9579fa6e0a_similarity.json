        "sentence": "How Do You Think Technology Affects Dating?\n\nHave you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?\n\nHow do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.\n\nThat first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.\n\nI have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.\n\nI simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.\n\nAre there nerves when you're FaceTiming or texting someone you're interested in? Of course. You don't want to embarrass yourself and say the wrong thing and ruin everything. But I'd much rather be embarrassed on one side of a telephone compared to being embarrassed in person. \n\nI also appreciate that dating apps allow people to be up front about what they're using them for. Some people use the apps looking for a relationship. Some are using the apps to just hook up. I find that refreshing because it allows you to really find what you're looking for, or at the very least search for it. I think in general dating apps and dating websites have had a positive affect on relationships. While I'm sure some people have had negative experiences using them, if I was a betting man I would say that the positive experiences greatly outweigh the negative ones. So there is obviously value in them and hopefully they're here to stay. \n",
