        "sentence": "What Stereotypical Characters Make You Cringe?\n\nWhat stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is when they are portrayed as a stereotype. It shows that the people who created the show or the movie don't understand the depths of a character and are shallow people in general. \n\nThere are many stereotypes in TV and film that make me cringe. A racist white man, a \"gangster\" black man, a dumb blonde all come to mind for me.  These characters are just directors taking the easy way out. The characters have no depth. The stereotype they are portraying is their personality.\n\nThat is very offensive to me. I understand why these roles are used in TV and film but it still bothers me if their entire character is just the stereotype. \n\nThere are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression.\n\nThe entire depth of his character wasn't that he was a stereotypical Italian. You kind of forgot about that while you were watching the show. \n\nThat to me is a stereotype done right, even though stereotypes have a negative stigma around them. And realistically, all stereotypes are negative. Some just don't offend me to a great extent.\n\nI definitely wouldn't watch a specific television show or a movie if a character was being portrayed in a highly offensive and stereotypical way. I understand that some people use stereotypes to teach a viewing audience about past culture. \n\nI also find stereotypes to be used less and less due to the societal backlash that comes with it. An audience isn't going to accept offensive stereotypes in movies and TV just because they're playing a character. The character has to have depth to them. \n\nStereotypes are wrong. They're just a way to get a cheap reaction out of a viewing audience. Some directors take pride in their work, and sadly some directors don't. \n",
