They were right, Matt Damon was no ordinary human, he went straight for the power converters and other vital systems. The aliens were not concerned though. Even though Matt was well versed in their technology they did not view his knowledge as a threat to them or the ship. Matt on the other hand was confident he could easily create a diversion using what he had at his disposal and escaping. Mr. Damon was right, he quickly took a crystal out of a circuit board looking device and swapped it with a penny. This caused the device to go into an energy intensive feedback loop. This was not possible the aliens said to each other. How can he be doing this but by the time they had telepathically discussed the nature of what was happening, the side of the ship blew open and the vacuum of space sucked everything out including Matt Damon, who was not harmed in anyway by emptiness of space and speed off towards his home planet, successfully stopping another alien invasion. \n",
