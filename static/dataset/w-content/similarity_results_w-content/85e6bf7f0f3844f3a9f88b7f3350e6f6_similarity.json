        "sentence": "Should Schools Provide Free Pads and Tampons?\n\nHave you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty\"? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?\n\n---\n\nWhile I have not ever experienced period shaming or period poverty, I know that such incidents exist from the perspectives of my close friends and the people I have interacted with in my life. I can emphasize nonetheless with their stigmas, and feel that such incidents should be prevented for females students for what is effectively a natural and widespread human experience. To prevent such stigmas and negative social demeaning, schools should provide free pads and tampons to students. Such items are relevant to the interests of schools as institutions of learning, and are necessary for the health and well-being of students that cannot easily afford such items. In addition, many students should view schools as safe environments for them to learn and interact with fellow students, for often they might lack such comfort at home or elsewhere in their life.

Despite the widespread use of pads and tampons, there are still many people who view them as taboo or dirty, especially male students that are in middle or high school. In any case, schools should still provide pads and tampons based on the benefits they bring to female students that require them and cannot access them by personal finances or means. Schools should take great efforts to avoid incurring stigmatization towards female students that request such products, by maintaining their confidentiality and privacy when asking and receiving the products.\n",
