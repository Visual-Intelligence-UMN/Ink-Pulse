I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel. \nI know that humans are suffering and I do think we should care about that. However, I think that we should care about the suffering of all living creatures and I don't think that caring for animals does anything to take away from caring for humans since it's common to care for both. So no, the amount of human suffering that exists does not make it wrong to focus on animal welfare. \nIf a person has been harmed by another person a lot in his or her life then I can imagine how their trusted animal companion would be held in a higher regard than a person, who they know might actually hurt them. Some people wrongly think that many people are a threat because of thing they have experienced. For them to care more about animals isn't wrong. \nThere are many explanations for why it's NOT wrong to focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer, but most importantly if people don't even care about animals, then who will?\n",
