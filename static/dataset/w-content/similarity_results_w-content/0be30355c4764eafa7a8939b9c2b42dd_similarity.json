In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, i dont find it wrong to focus on Animal Welfare. I say this because i dont feel we are ignoring human suffering. I think that there is just so much human suffering that we need to pick and choose where to divert our attention to. Likewise with animals, there are many animals that suffer on our planet. I think there needs to be some sort of moderation on both since it is unrealistic to think we can combat all suffering in both categories.  In addition to that, i think the media has sort of desensitized human suffering since it is so common. For this reason, we as humans have more of a emotional reaction when we see animals being taken advantage of over humans. We understand that both are wrong, however we see it so often for humans that we sort of just repress it in a way. I think that emotional reaction is still there if we see a kid being harmed, however a grown adult we just sort of brush aside. As far as the 40 percent saving their dog over a tourist, i think i would have to agree. Our dog is like family, so if there was a life to save i would probably go with my dog. I would not really be super sad if something happened to the tourist, simply because i do not know them personally. If something happened to my dog i would be extremely upset and saddened. Its an easy choice for me, but i would just relate it to family over non family.  So being more empathetic to suffering animals is really just something that society has done to us in a way i guess. It would be interesting to find out how humans would react to stimuli involing a human death and animal death, if they had grown up in an era with no media aside from writing. Maybe the reaction would be higher for humans because they can relate to a human death more. I dont find it wrong either way to focus on welfare of animals or humans, because if that is what your focused on that you are an empathetic individual. Everyone's perspective is different and what may cause one person to take the death of a human strongly, may not do the same to someone else. This is the beauty in everyone being different, and having had different experiences. Just from my own perspective, i think i would probably have the stronger reaction seeing a dog being beat by a bat over an adult. But if it was a child instead i think the child would take the cake over an animal, but thats just me. Anyway, in conclusion, i dont think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare at all, i think everyone is different and people are going to focus on what makes them most enthusiastic.\n",
