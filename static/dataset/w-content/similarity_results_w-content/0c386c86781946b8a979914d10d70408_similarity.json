You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.\n\n\n",

Even if it isn't something as important as politics or the pandemic, it's still your duty as a citizen. What if you had children and by not watching the news you missed hearing about a carnival in a neighboring town? Your family missed out on a chance to go do something fun and memorable. \n\nThere's different levels of importance when it comes to news. You don't have to keep up with celebrity news to be a citizen. However, you need to keep up with what is happening in the world. If that feels overwhelming, you at least need to know what is happening in your very own country. That is the only way you can make informed decisions. Because otherwise you are just blindly making decisions that not only have the potential to harm yourself but also your neighbors, friends and even your very own family. \n",
