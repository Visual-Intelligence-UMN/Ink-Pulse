Its one thing to keep up with current events, its another to compulsorily consume it. I'm sure there are plenty of people who get along just fine without keeping up with current events. They maybe doing better then some of us psychologically who do keep up with the news on a daily basis. Some news outlets are just more about keeping our attention then giving us things of substance. There are so many confilicting views, I can see how people would tune out. So I say no to being a bad person if you do not keep up with the news. Most of all you have the freedom to choose (in most countries).\n",
