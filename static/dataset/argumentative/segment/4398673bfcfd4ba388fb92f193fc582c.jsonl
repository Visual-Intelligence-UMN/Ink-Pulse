But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.

I mean, they do get a scholarship for their athletic ability, and some even get a partial scholarship because of their grades. If they weren't getting scholarships, I'd definitely be all for paying them. Of course, they'd have to figure out how much they'd be paid. Do college athletes realize that they are essentially being paid over $350,000 to play on their teams, because the value of the scholarships will pay tuition for four years, room fees, and food every day? It just shocks me that these students don't appreciate their scholarships, because many people would die just for a chance at getting a scholarship by the age of 18.\n\nI come from a family that doesn't have a lot of money, and I've seen the struggles they have gone through to make sure their children get an education. I mean, my mom is about to get her third job, in order to give the kids in our family an opportunity to go college, when she has already done her fair share by having two jobs on top of all her responsibilities at home. I have a lot of respect for her when it comes to what she has to do in order to put us through school, and it hurts me that college athletes aren't grateful for the opportunities they've been given. No, they don't get paid for all of their hard work they put in daily, but their scholarship covers it. And if they want to give up their scholarships they'll have to pay for their own education just like the rest of us do. Would they rather have that or a scholarship? They just can't have their cake and eat it too. That wouldn't be fair to the rest of us who can't afford college and still have to pay for it on our own.\n\nI'm not sure how persuasive I find Mr. McDavis' argument for his side of the debate. He seems more concerned about the distortion of the economics of college sports. To me, that sidesteps the real point at issue, which is the inequity of providing something like $350,000 to a bunch of teenagers that don't even understand the real value of that money.\n",

Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?\n\nIn “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,\" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.\"\n\nDo you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, there is no way that student athletes should be paid on these campuses, at the college level. I mean, they do get a scholarship for their athletic ability, and some even get a partial scholarship because of their grades. If they weren't getting scholarships, I'd definitely be all for paying them. Of course, they'd have to figure out how much they'd be paid. Do college athletes realize that they are essentially being paid over $350,000 to play on their teams, because the value of the scholarships will pay tuition for four years, room fees, and food every day? It just shocks me that these students don't appreciate their scholarships, because many people would die just for a chance at getting a scholarship by the age of 18.\n\nI come from a family that doesn't have a lot of money, and I've seen the struggles they have gone through to make sure their children get an education. I mean, my mom is about to get her third job, in order to give the kids in our family an opportunity to go college, when she has already done her fair share by having two jobs on top of all her responsibilities at home. I have a lot of respect for her when it comes to what she has to do in order to put us through school, and it hurts me that college athletes aren't grateful for the opportunities they've been given. No, they don't get paid for all of their hard work they put in daily, but their scholarship covers it. And if they want to give up their scholarships they'll have to pay for their own education just like the rest of us do. Would they rather have that or a scholarship? They just can't have their cake and eat it too. That wouldn't be fair to the rest of us who can't afford college and still have to pay for it on our own.\n\nI'm not sure how persuasive I find Mr. McDavis' argument for his side of the debate. He seems more concerned about the distortion of the economics of college sports. To me, that sidesteps the real point at issue, which is the inequity of providing something like $350,000 to a bunch of teenagers that don't even understand the real value of that money. I mean, I couldn't care less if some colleges have to go into a bidding war over a few studs, and I couldn't care less if a bunch of other colleges have to scramble financially to keep up. I just don't think it's right for these kids to make that much money by playing sports, which is something they do for fun during their free time.\n\nI have an acquaintance who vehemently disagrees with me on this issue. Her name is Soeurette and she's a women's lacrosse player at St. Lawrence University. She believes that athletes should be paid for their time on the varsity team. She points to the huge commitment that college athletes make in terms of their time and social lives. Even though I understand that perspective I note that Soeurette is one of the last people who should be advocating for pay to play, because she's the daughter of a successful businessman from France, who makes more money in a year than most Americans make in a lifetime.\n\nIn conclusion, \n",
