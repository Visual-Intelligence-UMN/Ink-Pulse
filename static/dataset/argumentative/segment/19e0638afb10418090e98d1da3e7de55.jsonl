The most important thing you can learn in school is how to learn.  If you know the basics of the research process, and also know enough basic facts to recognize how complicated most problems are, you can probably figure out the rest for yourself.  I think it took me well into my college years to be able to say that I finally understood these things, and sadly, many students will not have that same opportunity.  And that is why I think that schools should concentrate on fundamentals, but also on pragmatics.  \n\nI hope that future generations will be taught how to teach themselves to deal with unique problems, but I also hope that they will be taught exactly how to deal with the most common problems.\n",
