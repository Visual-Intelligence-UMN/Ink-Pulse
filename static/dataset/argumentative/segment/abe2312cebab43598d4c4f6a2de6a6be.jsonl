In fact, I think it is the right thing to do.  I think that people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people because animals are innocent; they do not have the ability to make choices, and they are not responsible for their actions. Humans, on the other hand, are responsible for their actions and have the ability to make choices.  So, an animal that is suffering cannot be responsible for its suffering, while a human who is suffering often is.\n\nThis being the case, it is right thing  to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we have a moral obligation to help those who are innocent and cannot help themselves.  Humans are often responsible for their own suffering, and they have the ability to help themselves, or should. By focusing on animal welfare over that of humans, we are merely living up to a basic moral principle.  In fact, if we were to focus on the well-being of humans instead in this situation, we would be doing something wrong.\n",
