They should be paid a percentage of ticket sales. I do not agree that the broader community would be harmed. This is real life. Times change. It is fair that if the college makes a great sum of income, that some of it go to the players. Colleges in bidding wars? They do that anyway, but without money. They bid for the best. The athletes would receive no compensation until they graduate, again, which would be a percentage of tickets sold. \n\nIf colleges did not profit on their athletes, then no, they should not be paid.

Having good sports is a boon to the colleges. They get televised or broadcasted which increases brand awareness. There are some things that are hard to measure, like how much exposure they get and what it is worth. \n\n",
