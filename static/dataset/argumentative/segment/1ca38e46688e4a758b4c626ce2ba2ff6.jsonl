        "text": "Is It Selfish to Pursue Risky Sports Like Extreme Mountain Climbing?\n\nSome sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, the question of whether some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport is really one about degree. How dangerous are they? There's something that is dangerous but widely accepted such as school sports. Even though you might break a bone (or fracture something), we know that statistically we'll be ok. Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die. There's always the possibility. \n\nSo if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate. We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in barrel. I think we'd all agree that didn't serve some greater purpose. However there are people who go mountain climbing not for glory, but as a challenge to themselves. It's a personal goal. Is that selfish? It's hard to say. Then there's people who do these things to make money. Some people make money filming themselves hanging from famous landmarks or parachuting from them.
