What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, the most important thing to learn in school are basic everyday life concepts that our kids nowadays are severely lacking. Kids nowadays know how to TikTok and know every detail on their favourite movie (for example people such as Miranda Sings) but they have no idea what mistakes to avoid or how to handle different situations such as filing their taxes, registering to vote, or making sure who they vote for actually represents their opinions, or how to succeed in their job.\n\nIt's absolutely critical to have our usual subjects such as science and math, which are worth everything in today's world, but kids should also learn other subjects that I think are just as important, even though they get pretty much no attention anywhere, such as civics or politics, or how to achieve things rather than narcissistic topics. There should be a restructuring in how students get admitted to college. Instead of relying on the one board exam they do, which often tests knowledge in irrelevant areas, kids should be evaluated on how they handle themselves in their high school and how they interact in a team environment. Because in reality, the student's lifetime careers involve them working in more group projects than they will ever deal with on an exam.\n\nLet's also not forget that other life-saving lessons such as how to last in relationships, knowing how to deal with authority, and how to handle losing should be taught in schools for students' benefit. There are too many examples that I am sure you know about news of kids that are getting pregnant or struggling through relationships striking over social media. There are also a stark anger towards the police and how others see them, which I think stems from a lack of knowledge that authorities have rights to stop people just as much as you do, and that people are being falsely arrested because of this.\n\nAnd lastly, let's not forget all about how there are too many school shootings that are happening in our country. It's a very sad reality and I wish that at a very young age, our students get taught how to be aware of things that are happening around them, and that there are actual serious consequences to taking lives. It's too easy to be angry and to be in the wrong mindset, when instead they could have an open mind to hear both sides of a story, even if they are different from the ones they are brought up with. We should teach kids how to be tolerant to ideas that are different than theirs, because it's not often that they will be convinced to change, but they most certainly need to know how to live with people with vastly different mindset.\n\nSo there you have it, I think those three ideas that I have are the ones that should be taught more regularly in our schools today so that we could welcome more successful and more prepared bunch of our youth today to further tackle different issues in the future. The world is changing, and they need all the help they could get so that \n",
