There's many that we can't even imagine that will arise in the future. The best thing is to just say no and never open that doorway. Once you do, you never know what will happen. The one thing we do know though is that it isn't fair to students who are not athletes. All students who pay to go to college should be treated equal. This isn't high school after all. \n",
