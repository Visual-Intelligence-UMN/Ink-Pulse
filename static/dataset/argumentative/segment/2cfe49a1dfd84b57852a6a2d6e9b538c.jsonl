Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.\n\nSo then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade? What's the point of a school that, upon completion, requires yet more school? If the end result of all this is employment, and I think we have to acknowledge that it is, those 16 years were an almost complete waste of time. Is it really fair, or reasonable, to subject students to a decade and a half of compulsory education, when the end result is that they have to spend another decade and a half learning things that they should have learned in the first place? Is it fair for it to be done at the taxpayer's expense?\n\nI say that it's not. Students are given over to the school for all that time by parents, and the school is supported in its endeavors by the taxpayer, with an expectation of producing useful results, as measured by employability. For all that time and money to be spent for nothing, isn't just an example of misplaced priorities in education. It's a crime.\n",
