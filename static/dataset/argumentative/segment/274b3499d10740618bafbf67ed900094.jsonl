It will be up to us to use it in a way that helps make our process of finding the right person for us healthier and more purposeful. Or up to us to make sure we are able to utilize technology in a way that doesnt take away from our relationship once we are in one. I think dating apps are a huge asset to the dating life of individuals. I think they really put you out there to a much larger variety of people opposed to meeting people at specific locations. There are people out there like single moms and dads who simply would not be able to meet anyone else without the use of a dating app. With the dating app, they actually find very high quality relationships with people who are looking for the same thing that they are. I personally met my wife on a dating app and would never have met someone so compatible without the app itself. If i did then it most likely would have taken much longer than it did with the app. I think dating apps are one of the best parts of technology if used right. Of course there are going to be people who abuse the privledge and use it to only try to hook up and harass people, but this comes with any good thing out there. Eggs are on of the healthiest foods on the planet, but that means that farmers are going to try to mass produce and drug their animals to make a ton of them. If you feed the animals healthy food and let them out in the sun on a pasture, they are going to produce great quality eggs! \n",

As far as being in a relationship i think technology has the chance to take away from present time, so you need to be very weary to not let it get in the way of that. Netflix can be used to spend time together instead of time apart, so use it wisely! So in conclusion, i feel technology can be great for dating and relationships if used correctly.\n",
