        "text": "Should College Athletes Be Paid?\n\nDo you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?\n\nIn “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,\" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.\"\n\nDo you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, college athletes should be paid by anyone that wants to pay them. It's a free country.  Anyone that wants to give them money has the right to do so.   It's not like they are getting paid by the school. That would definitely be an unethical act. But if the money is from an outside source or sponsor, then it's not a problem. I think anyone that gets paid in college is lucky. They are getting paid to play a sport. They could use the money to pay for their tuition and college expenses.  They could use the money to secure housing and set up their future. I can see why some people are against college athletes getting paid. They are afraid that the college athletes will get greedy and want more money. Also, they are afraid that the college athletes will be distracted from their studies. But I think with the right guidance, the college athletes will be able to balance their studies and their sports.\n",
