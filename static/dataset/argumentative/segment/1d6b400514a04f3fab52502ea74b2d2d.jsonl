The disconnect between the urban populations and rural populations are incredible. They believe almost the opposite of what the other believes. Its becoming more like tribalism then activism. So the less informed we are about objective information and the more we rely on our own news bubbles we will continue to fracture and the country will suffer terribly because of it. We will keep electing leaders with the same misinformed views and the cycle will go on until today's congress looks like the good old days. \n",
