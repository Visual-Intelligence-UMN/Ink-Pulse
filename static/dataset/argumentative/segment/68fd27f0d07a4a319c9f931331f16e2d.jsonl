        "text": "How Worried Should We Be About Screen Time During the Pandemic?\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.\n\nBut should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, the increased screen time during the pandemic, is one of the least of our problems right now. Sure, too much time in front of a computer or TV can be bad for you, but the pandemic, as well as many of the other social and environmental changes we've experienced over the past year or so, are much more worthy of our attention. For example, increased screen time can lead to eye strain. Covid, on the other hand, can lead to a massive strain on the health care system, and vast loss of life. Spending too much time on social media can be wasteful and unproductive.
