I can now use this time to learn new subjects or to absorb engaging fiction.  This gives me more opportunities to learn than I would have had if I had to sit down and read a book, without doing anything else.\n\nI would think that you would learn just as much by listening to a book being read to you vs. reading the words off of a page, and it seems to work for me.  Other people might not find it so easy to retain information that they hear.  \n\nSo this is one of the key strengths of Audiobooks: the convenience factor.  There are other people who might find it difficult to actually read printed words.  Those who suffer from dyslexia, for example, are just as capable of learning as anyone else, but reading is physically difficult for them.  For these people, audiobooks would be a great improvement over printed words, even if they choose not to multitask.\n\nI will however say that there are some subjects that I have had difficulty learning from an audiobook, including math and physics.  Subjects such as these often require visual aids such as diagrams and printed equations, so they do not lend themselves to an audio format.  People who have trouble reading, however might use a hybrid approach, in which they listen to an audio version of the material, while holding the book in front of them.  This would allow them to pause and view diagrams, when necessary.\n\nObviously, books about art history and fashion would also suffer in an audio format, as photographs are a key part of the material.  \n\nTo summarize, I would encourage any reader to give audiobooks a try.  They may find that it allows them to learn more than they ever thought possible.\n\nHowever, I do not dispute the simple pleasure of sitting down and reading.  Personally, I like to read light fiction myself as a way to unwind and fall asleep at the end of a long day.  Listening to audio books does not provide me with the same level of relaxation, but again, this is a matter of personal preference.  \n\n\n",

There are even books that are narrated by their own authors, or by celebrity actors.  \n\nOne book that was recently recommended to me is How to Read a Book by Mortimer Adler and Charles Van Doren.  I might pass this recommendation along in either its printed or its audio format to anyone who is interested in reading or listening to more serious educational content in their lives.\n\nAs we have seen, absorbing more books may be a lot easier than you think, so what are you waiting for?\n\nI don't have anything else to say, but thousands of authors do!\n",
