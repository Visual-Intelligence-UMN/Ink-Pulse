Girls would occasionally have an \"accident\" and students would make fun of them, but junior high school students are cruel, and they make fun of everyone, for a variety of reasons.

Is it possible that in schools now,  the situation is different? I'm puzzled to explain why this would be. Are students poorer now? Are they more likely to be mocked by increasingly cruel peers? Are young women now more likely to be uniformed about their periods? Or are they just less responsible and less capable of taking care of themselves?\n\nI suspect in this case, as well as with many others, the problem is not that the schools are failing to provide pads and tampons, but that the students are failing to take responsibility for themselves, because they are less well informed and responsible than they should be.
