Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, stereotypes such as the \"dumb blonde\" or the \"loud black woman\" are offensive because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.\n\nHowever, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people. Human knowledge progresses, and as it does, so does our understanding of the world and the people in it. So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now.\n",

Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.\n\nHowever, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people. Human knowledge progresses, and as it does, so does our understanding of the world and the people in it. So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today. \n\nThat being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the \"dumb blonde\" or the \"loud black woman\" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them. And strangely, while the number of people who complain about stereotypes has increased drastically, the number of stereotypes that are used in modern works hasn't decreased a bit. In fact, I find more stereotypes in modern works, than in \n",
