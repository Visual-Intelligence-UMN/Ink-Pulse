I guess the movies with negative stereotypes of minorities must be money makers. What if they weren't any longer? Would that cause the writers to think outside the box and see the world as it really is and not as it has been in their skewed minds. Stereotypes hurt progress of all people becoming better people and need to be stopped. \n",
