In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. We can focus on both at the same time. We don't have to put all of our focus towards one topic. \n\nAnimal cruelty is horrible just like cruelty against humans is horrible. No living thing should be harmed physically, mentally or spiritually by another living thing. \n\nBut again, I think we can help animals and humans at the same time. We can rescue animals from shelters instead of buying them off breeders. We can help get rid of the drug problem that causes so much crime. \nI am not surprised to learn that humans are more empathetic towards animals compared to other humans. I think that probably stems from humans having more positive experiences with animals and more negative experiences with humans. \n\nThere's news stories every single day that talk about all the horrible things that the human species does including murder, war, robbery, etc. That sours humans for a lot of us. While I personally believe that every human has some good in them, I know that many others don't feel that way at all. \n\nI think that many humans also consider their pets as part of their family. I know I do. If I saw my dog getting beaten by a baseball bat I'd do everything in my power to save him. If I saw another human getting beaten by a baseball bat, I'd also try to help. If I was forced to choose, I'd have to help my dog simply because I consider my dog to be family. I know many other people think that way too.\n\nDogs are the best. They aren't known as mans best friend for no reason. Most dogs are more loyal than most humans. That's a sad fact. As humans we should be doing everything we can do help end animal cruelty. An animal can't defend itself against a human in most cases and anyone that would harm an animal is a despicable person. \n\nLets focus on animal welfare and lets focus on lowering human suffering. Lets make the world a better place. \n",
