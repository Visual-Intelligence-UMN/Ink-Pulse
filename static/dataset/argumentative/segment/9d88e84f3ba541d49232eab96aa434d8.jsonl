While the players doing sports in school, at the same time, will have a chance to really excel in whatever they do. All, or most, of their motivation would come from the prospect of being able to do something in college that they love and get paid for it at the same time. All while majoring in another few subjects. \n\nThe colleges make tons of money from these players, so I do not find the argument that they should not be paid feasible even in the slightest. Did I also mention that it would help bring more \"minorities\"  into college for a chance to achieve their dreams and leave them in a better place for their life. Parents would also be proud, and more inclined to encourage their children to try to get into college at the same time.  \n",
