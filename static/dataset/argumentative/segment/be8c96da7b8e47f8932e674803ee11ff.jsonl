Universities benefit much from college athletes, more so from the ones that have high prestige, performance, and reputation. The bidding wars and other excessive costs that universities pay for their athletes are in part of their own vocation, something that can be prevented through more regulation, and effecitvely the fair treatment of all college athletes for their efforts. These can be reduced so that the university will not impact other students, while still being able to pay athletes for their efforts that is necessary for them to continue their sports career, while also furthering their educational career.\n",
