Unfortunately media has been doing this more and more which also makes it harder for the average person to weed through all the nonsense and it can be discouraging. We need to get our facts straight and start agreeing on some fundamental, objective truths and work from there. Then maybe more people would be willing to keep up if there was more truth in the media instead of opinion.\n",
