When I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a media company's portrayal of a generic starving person in Africa. \n\nWe should however, focus more on our own species. We do have the power to affect things, and shouldn't feel powerless to improve lives, and remove pain. We can donate to food pantries, visit nursing homes, volunteer to build houses, and mentor children.  All of these as easy-to-do, and give us power to control the suffering around us.  We can make humans healthier and happier, and happy people in turn, don't hurt other people or animals. \n\n\n",
