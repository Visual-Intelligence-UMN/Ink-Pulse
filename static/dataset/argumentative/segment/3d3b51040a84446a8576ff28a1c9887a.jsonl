Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?\n\nIn “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,\" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games).
