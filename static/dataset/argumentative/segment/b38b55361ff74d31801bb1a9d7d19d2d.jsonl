Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling. \n",

I was never afraid of getting hurt in any sport, i was simply afraid of being in my own head. I would do anything just not to be in my own head. So i definitely get the person that is doing mountain climbing for peace of mind and for that adrenaline rush that some of us so desperately need. That rush that we can not get outside of the sport. \n",
