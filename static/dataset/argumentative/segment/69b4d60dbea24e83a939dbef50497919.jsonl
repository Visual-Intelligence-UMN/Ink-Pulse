Why do you think the way you do?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function.

I think it is useful, but not for the reasons most people do. It is needed on a local level, to know what is going on in your community, and to be able to participate in local issues, and to respond in case of local emergencies. On a national level, it is needed to know what is going on in your country that might directly affect you, like changes in the law, or larger natural disasters, or massive economic shifts, so that you can respond appropriately. However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.\n\nThe reasons for this are myriad. First of all, the news is not objective, and is often deliberately misleading. If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable. That being the case, following the news can suck up a lot of time, and time is a valuable resource, that might be better devoted to meeting one's actual obligations. The news can also be very upsetting, and can cause unnecessary anxiety and stress.\n",
