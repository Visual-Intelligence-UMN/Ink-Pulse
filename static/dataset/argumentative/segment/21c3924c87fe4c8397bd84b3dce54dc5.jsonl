Critical thinking is a method that is taught specifically in higher education for certain professions, such as healthcare professionals. However, it is not taught in a general sense.

By shadowing adults as they work through everyday problems and problem solving, children are able to learn how to think critically in a more natural setting. This allows for a smoother transition into higher education and working age. \n",
