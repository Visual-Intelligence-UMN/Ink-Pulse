I have to lend them my phone or tablet, and I don't want to do that. With a physical book. I can just hand them the book and they can give it back when they are done. It gives me the pleasure of knowing I have shared something that I enjoy with someone hoping that they will enjoy it as well. \nI am not saying that there are no advantages to audiobooks, but more why I greatly prefer physical books over an audiobook any day.\n",
