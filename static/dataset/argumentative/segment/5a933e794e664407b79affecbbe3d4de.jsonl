The infamous \"Netflix and Chill\" date that people talk about is certainly a relic of a new tech-focused world, but is really not much more than a date that ends in \"coffee\" at one's apartment.  It was just a polite way to invite someone over for what you assume will be an intimate encounter.  Netflix has merely provided an opening that some people may mutually exploit.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that the future of dating will continue to be technology-focused, and I think that this is ultimately a good thing.  It will benefit a lot of people, and the one's who think that it is excessive, are probably the ones who had no trouble finding dates in the offline world.\n",
