Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, there are benefits to listening compared to reading when it comes to books. The first one that pops into my head is the ability to listen to a book while I'm on the go. When I am driving to work I can put an audiobook on and get the information that way. Obviously when I am driving I have to focus on the road and therefore wouldn't be able to read a physical book on my commute.\n\nI also love that audiobooks don't take up any physical space. A book shelf can get packed very quickly and then decisions have to be made. I don't really like to throw books out because I like them for decoration purposes. With an audiobook, I simply have it stored on an app that I can only using my laptop or my cell phone. I also can access these no matter where I am. As people we always have our cell phones on us. I find it much harder to carry a book around. \n\nThe advantages that I think come with an actual book is the ability to read at your own pace. Some audiobooks the speed is too high or too low no matter how much you change the speed settings. When I read a physical book, I can read at my own pace. \n\nI also enjoy looking at the pictures in a book that are specifically found in biographies. Since an audiobook is just audio, you can't see the pictures. \n\nI prefer to use audiobooks just because of the convenience of them. I love having the ability to lay in my bed before I go to sleep and listen to a chapter. It helps relax me. \n\nI also want to make it clear that I love reading physical books as well. Both methods give a unique experience to the reader and I don't think either method is going to go away anytime soon. It ultimately comes down to personal preference and situation.\n\nWhether you read a physical book or you listen to an audiobook, reading is a great way to exercise our mind. I love it. \n\n",
