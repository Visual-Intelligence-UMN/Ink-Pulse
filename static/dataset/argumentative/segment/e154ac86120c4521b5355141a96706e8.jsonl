Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling.
