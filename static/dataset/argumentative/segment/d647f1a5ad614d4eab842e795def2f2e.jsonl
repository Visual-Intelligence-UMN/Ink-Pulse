This could easily not have occured had people not engaged with the news that are available to them, and the information present and accesible during the current digital age. Although as I mentioned many might hear said news and not engage with it to the same degree as others, I believe it isn't inherently difficult based on the demands and obligations many people have, which might make it more difficult for them to keep up with the news. As long as others do keep up with the news, to bring about discussion, action, and change for the better, it will be an overall positive outcome for people to have such information readily available through different formats and medias.\n",
