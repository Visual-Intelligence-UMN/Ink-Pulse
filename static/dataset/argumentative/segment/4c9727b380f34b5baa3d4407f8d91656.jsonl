If they are shamed for being unable to purchase pads and tampons, the shame can also be extended to other areas of their lives that is affected by poverty and finances, and they as a consequence may feel like they are not worthy of anything. For female students, being period shamed for whatever reasons that may be will affect the quality of education they receive, and also affect their ability to learn.\n\nGiven the negative outcomes of period shaming, schools should take greater initiatives to prevent them as well as ensure they offer safe and comfortable learning environments for their students. To do so, at the minimum, schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons to its students. Schools already provide other products that are necessary for students to learn. In addition, schools provide hygienic items such as toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products. Pads and tampons are both hygienic items that offers comfort during a stressful time for many female students, which in turn allows them to learn and further their educational career. While pads and tampons are quite similar in its usefulness and necessity to other hygienic items provided by school, there is also important considerations to be made regarding their distribution. \n\nSchools that are required to provide free pads and tampons should do so in a way that is not ostracizing the students for choosing to use such products, while also providing them anonymity and privacy. This can be done by providing them in a private area of the school, such as the nurse’s office or a private bathroom. By preventing the identities of female students who receive free pads and tampons from being known to other students, they can avoid being shamed for their periods and for being unable to afford pads and tampons. Ideally, the school should also teach the students how to use both products, as well as provide them with information regarding menstruation and the female body. That way, periods can be normalized as natural body processes and female students will feel comfortable in their bodies, being free to study and learn without being shamed for having periods or for using pads and tampons.\n",
