Their experiences have been very impactful to my thoughts and perspectives, and I empathize with the pain and discomfort they have gone through in school. The idea that anyone should be treated as than equal to others in school due to something out of their control is just illogical, and should definitely be stopped. Schools can do so regarding periods simply by providing free pads and tampons to students, just like it does with toilet paper, soap, and other hygienic items. These items should not be viewed as costs to the schools, but rather investments in ensuring the health and well-being of its students, who often have a hard time just talking about bodily functions due to societal taboos. Ensuring the health and well-being of its students will be of great benefit to their education, as, without both, one can not function optimally nor focus on their studies and learning.\n\nPads and tampons are quite similar to other hygienic items, especially bandages and plasters offered by the school. They both involve the stoppage of bleeding, and prevent people from staining their clothes, which is a positive outcome for them. The key thing to note is that pads and tampons still have a social stigma associated with them, thus greater care must be taken in their distribution. For example, schools should make sure that pads and tampons are distributed in areas where they are not visibly seen by students, who may ridicule them afterwards for asking for such items. Privacy must be maintained for the female students, as it ensures their comfort and ease in asking for said items. Furthermore, schools should ensure that the female students’ access to such items are as easy as possible, as those with periods may already suffer from pain and would not want to go through difficult means to acquire them. Pads and tampons ought to be available in schools freely for students that require them, as they are beneficial to their comfort and education, but care must be taken to ensure that their distribution does not cause further ridicule or shaming from the other students.\n",
