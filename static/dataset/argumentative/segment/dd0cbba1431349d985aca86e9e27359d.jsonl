In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, people are more empathetic towards the suffering on animals compared to people because most animals are good. People do messed up things all the time. Murder, robbery, fights, drunk driving, so many negative things that humans do on a daily basis that makes people turn to animals.\n\nA dog is known as man's best friend and that is for a reason. Dogs are loyal and are always there for us. Sometimes they are even more loyal than family and friends. I don't think this issue needs to be cut and dry. \n\nWe can care about both humans and animals at the same time. I don't think it's wrong to focus on the welfare of animals when humans are suffering. I also don't think it's wrong to focus on the suffering of humans when animal cruelty is a thing.\n\nWe should be trying to solve both issues instead of prioritizing one more than the other. \n\nI'm also not surprised to hear that a majority of people found it more upsetting to hear about a dog being beaten by a baseball bat compared to a man. How is a dog supposed to defend itself against a baseball bat? A human can at least try to wrestle the bat away and grab it. A dog can't grab a baseball bat. A dog also has a much lesser lifespan than a human and that may play a role in a human beings thoughts when it comes to these scenarios.\n\nAnimal cruelty is absolutely disgusting and someone that participates in it should be in jail for at least 10 years in my opinion. One of the cruelest things that you can do is hurt a defenseless animal. Those people are the lowest form of human. They're despicable.\n\nIn the future, lets do our best to take care of both humans and animals that are suffering. Doing so will make this world a much better place. \n",
