The reality is that such limits are impractical for most, and some other type of moderation is required that is tailored to a specific individual. I believe that people should be more aware of their screen use, and be more conscious of how much time they spend on their screens. This can easily be done by checking system settings and seeing total screen time, or by manually counting how often a person is on their devices. Ideally, screen use should be limited if not avoided prior to going to bed, if not possible a blue light filter should be used to reduce blue light exposure, which studies have shown affect the sleep cycle's of people. Use of blue light filters in general can reduce the drawbacks of prolonged screen use\n",

Thus, it is key that people find a balance in their life, especially during the pandemic and other times where they are unable to interact with others in person to moderate their screen use, to maximize its benefits and reduce its drawbacks. Most people have the ability to moderate themselves and avoid incurring negative health consequences, people in society have the means to learn how and resources should be available. For that, I believe it is unnecessary for most to worry about the dangers of dependency on digital devices and screen use. \n",
