At the end of the day stereotypes are wrong and offensive. They perpetuate traits and characteristics that are way too general of a specific race, religion, etc. \n\nAt the end of the day, Tony Soprano was a stereotype. He is one of the most beloved characters in TV history. Even by Italians who could be offended by his character. Italians loved Tony Soprano and the show in general.\n\nYou also have to remember that some television shows and movies have to include stereotypes to fit the time period they're depicted in. For example, during the slavery era there are tons of people depicted racist white people. That is a stereotype as not every single white person was a racist back then. \n\nThese stereotypes can also be used as a learning tool. Movies about slavery teach children why it was so horrific and why being racist is bad. Stereotypes are tricky for me when it comes to films and television. Things that would offend me in real life don't offend me in movies and television. I guess that I am just able to separate real life and movies/television. Maybe I don't buy in enough and lose myself in the media.\n\nAt the end of the day, stereotypes suck and the people who perpetuate them do as well.\n",
