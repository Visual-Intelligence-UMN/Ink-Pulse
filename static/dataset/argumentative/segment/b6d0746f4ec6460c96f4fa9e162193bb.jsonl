I can also better understand how to pace myself in order to gain skills and knowledge, and not overextend myself which could lead to negative consequences. This includes in determining the optimal way for me to study for exams, as I am aware of how I best study, and that I know that spreading my study sessions is optimal for me to retain knowledge. \n\nI think that this knowledge will help me in the future, especially in my career as it will guide my actions, and will allow me to apply myself in the workplace. It will help me identify opportunities that I can pursue, and I can remove any sense of hesitance by knowing that I am capable of pursuing the opportunity if I put my full effort towards it, and also work on it by utilizing my skills and strengths to the fullest. In other cases, the knowledge I learned from school will help me coordinate and work with colleagues, in maintaining a steady communication between one another, and allocating resources and work load to optimally achieve a deadline. The knowledge I gain from school has helped me trust in my abilities and allowed me to hold a stable sense of self-esteem, alongside with the ability to trust in others that I closely work with. In conclusion, I think that is why knowing ones strengths and weaknesses and learning how to apply oneself is the most important thing students should learn in school, given how universal such knowledge can be applied to the lives of students, both in their career and also in their personal interests.\n",
