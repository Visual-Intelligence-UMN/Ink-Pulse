While there are shows that can make me feel sad or even uncomfortable with what it depicts, in those instances those are intended in either a more thought-provoking way, or respectful manner. I am not referring to those types of cases, and instead refer to how stereotypical characters can feel insulting and unrealistic in the context of a show, movie, and book.

If I feel that I am not being valued or respected as a viewer watching the show or reading a book, I would prefer to read or view something else. I know there are much more respectful ways for creators to portray characters in their shows, movies, books, etc. than the ones that portray them as no more than stereotypes, and those are a better use of my time. \n",

Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?\n\n---\n\nI can easily say that I cringe notably when I see stereotypical characters in any form of media that effectively portrays people and certain demographics in a negative and offensive way. I cringe from these types of characters because I not only find them lazily written and one-dimensional, but that they are a negative addition to any show, book, or movie, that has consequences to its viewers. Not only do such characters illicit negative responses from other people who find them offensive, but they also perpetuate negative ideas and responses about these character groups in the real world. Many people hold stereotypes towards racial groups, as well as other types of minorities. Stereotypical characters reinforce those stereotypes and thus become a way to perpetuate and even justify negative and stigmatized attitudes towards those character groups. This can lead to said groups being viewed as lesser, even potentially dehumanized. I cannot say that I am willing to accept those characters in any media or content that I consume, given that their presence or implementation are not necessary, or a meaningful addition by the writers or creators of said content. \n\nFor some pieces of media, if the portrayal of a stereotypical character is too offensive or disingenuous and a critically seen part of the content, then I will either avoid that show, book or movie. Seeing such characters are not pleasant for me personally, which is also true of other people, and I don't enjoy engaging with shows that overall make me feel uncomfortable or negative in some way.
