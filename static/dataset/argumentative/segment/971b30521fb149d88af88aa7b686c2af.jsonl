In most cases, these suggested conditions have been met satisfactorily, so I don't think that any sports are too dangerous to be called a sport. Sports should also be conducted freely so that the players will have a sense of freedom. Instead of violating the principles of sport, I recommend that we should create education programs to increase awareness of sports and to teach players how to use their skills to prevent accidents in practice or competition. If it is their own choice to participate in a sport, why shouldn’t people be able to voluntarily take on additional risk? Because there are many risks in life, just as there are dangers in sport. However, even if the number of accidents is slightly higher than the number of accidents occurring in other activities, it's a valid idea for athletes to make their own choice. Why can’t the choice make all of those involved feel good? While it is understandable that people are concerned about the risk of injury in sport, shouldn’t we also have feelings about how exciting and attractive sports? To conclude, I think that  no sports are too dangerous to be called a sport, nor is it selfish to pursue risky sports.\n",
