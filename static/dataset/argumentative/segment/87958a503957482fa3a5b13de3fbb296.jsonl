        "text": "Is It Selfish to Pursue Risky Sports Like Extreme Mountain Climbing?\n\nSome sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, this is a personal preference and should be left up to each individual. Some people are willing to risk serious injury and even death for the sake of a thrill adventure, and others are not. Since these activities involve so much physical exertion, strength, and skill, they absolutely should be considered sports. I would go so far as to say they are much more of a sport than something such as golf or curling. \n\nFor the people who do enjoy extreme sports, there are some precautions that should be taken to ensure they remain safe. As with any activity in life that involves a modicum of risk, people have to be careful and follow recommended guidelines and safety protocols that have been developed to mitigate injury. Most people that participate in extreme sports, have been doing so for a great portion of their lives. They have followed others who perform these sports and are up to date on what safety measures are in place to protect themselves.  Furthermore, those who wish to engage in these sports need to consider the risks they are willing to take and determine whether those risks outweigh the satisfaction they get from participating in these activities. As I stated, it seems to be a matter of preference. \n\nI believe that one of the ultimate goals of any sport should be to remain safe and injury-free, and not only while you are participating in the sport, but also if you are teaching it to others. This is why proper safety gear is required when participating in a sport, such as helmets, knee and elbow pads, wrist guards, and other support gear. If someone chooses to ignore regulations for safety, that comes back on them as an individual and shouldn't be a black mark against the sport as a whole. Many people participate in extreme sports because it's exhilarating, fun and a great way to challenge yourself. \n\nIf we were to state that extreme sports shouldn't be called a sport because they are too dangerous we are setting ourselves up to make a similar statement against firefighting or police work as a profession. I know that may seem a poor comparison, but these things would have to be considered. Once we place limitations of people's free time and what they can or can't do, other things will start to follow suite. To that end, can motorcycles be considered safe transportation. Or could\n",
