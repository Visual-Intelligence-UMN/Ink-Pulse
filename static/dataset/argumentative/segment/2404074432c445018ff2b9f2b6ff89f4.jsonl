But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.\"\n\nDo you find his argument persuasive?

Schools should make as many opportunities as possible for students to get paid. I think that if students are good at something, they should be paid for it. I think this is especially good in STEM fields because students who are good at STEM fields can make a lot of money. If they have good chances of making a lot of money professionally, why not let them get paid for their work now? If only college athletes are being offered a lot of money for their skill, this could lead to jealousy and resentment from other students. Fairness is important. \n\nOne thing to consider is separating athletes into their own school. This would allow them to get paid for their work and not have to worry about other students getting jealous. This would also allow them to focus more on their sport and not have to worry about schoolwork. This could lead to a new generation of primed athletes. \n",
