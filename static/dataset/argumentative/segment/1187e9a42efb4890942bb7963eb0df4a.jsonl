Why do you think the way you do?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think we have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world. If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. \n\nEven if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. \n\nEspecially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. \n\nI also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.  If you don't stay up to date with politics, you're condemning your children's future by your apathy. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.\n\nJust by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.
