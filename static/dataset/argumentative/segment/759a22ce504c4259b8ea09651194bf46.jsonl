        "text": "How Worried Should We Be About Screen Time During the Pandemic?\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.\n\nBut should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. \n\nIf we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together. And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she told me she had booked the best caterer in all of Southeast Asia. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. \n\nSo in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time. \n\nIn summary, I think smart words to live by are to Be Safe and Stay Connected!\n",
