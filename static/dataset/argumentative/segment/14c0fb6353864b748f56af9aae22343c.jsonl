Not only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well. Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.\n\nSecond is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?\n\nIt may sound as a very big burden and I may sound that I do not support extreme sports, but in actuality I do. But at the same time, I do want those participating to take these issues into account because there really is no reason why innocent people should suffer in the process. Because yes, a family left behind without any financial support for the rest of their young lives are going to suffer, and they would suffer badly. So, my tip with people wanting to participate in extreme sports is very simple. Plan for it beforehand.\n",
