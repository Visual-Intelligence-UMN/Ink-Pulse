Dating apps group a bunch of people together who want similar relationships, and this makes it much easier!

You know from the jump what the other person is looking for, and this allows you to invest more into the relationship from the jump. You are able to be open about your feelings and open about your expectations because you know the other person is also looking for something similar. \n\nI personally have done dating with and without dating apps. I have had three girlfriends just going through high school and college, as it was much easier to meet people this way. When i graduated college, i was not interested in going to bars or parties, so i chose to use a dating app instead of simply waiting for the right person to find me. Although i met some people who i did not think i would be with for a long time, it really increased my perspective in what i wanted in a relationship. Later on, i met my fiance on a dating app whom I hit it off with right away. There is still a degree of luck to a dating app i would say, but probably less than simply being in the right place at the right time to meet people in person. Dating apps to me are just more of a way to get dates, to find your person. I still much rather talk on the app for only a couple of days and then meet in person for an official date. So to me personally, it is not super different. \n",

Technology and apps are simply something that are going to be around, and with any positive comes a negative as you can use and abuse the positive. If the technology is taking away from your personal time with your significant other than it is time to dial it back. If you find yourself on social media when your partner wants you attention, this is a red flag. However, if you are using an app like netflix productively, and enjoying a show with your signficant other and cuddling, this can be a positive. It is all about balance. Anything that is good also needs to be used in balance. \n",
