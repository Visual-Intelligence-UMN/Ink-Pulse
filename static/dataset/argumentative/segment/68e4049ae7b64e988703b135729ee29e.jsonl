The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry that generates millions of dollars in revenue. The athletes are the ones who generate this revenue, and they should be compensated for their efforts. They put in lots of extra time to do the sports and some of them may come from poor families. They deserve to be paid.  On one hand, they can be properly recognized and on the other hand, poor families can be subsidized. \n\nI suggest a fair nominal amount should be paid to the athletes as a kind of incentive. That amount should be less than the monetary reward paid to professional athletes. In this way, colleges would not be caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford. The economics of college sports would not be distorted due to the amount being paid is only nominal but not competitive. And some poor families can be subsidized for the related costs of playing the sports. \n\nAs a conclusion, college athletes should be paid with nominal monetary compensation. \n\n\n",
