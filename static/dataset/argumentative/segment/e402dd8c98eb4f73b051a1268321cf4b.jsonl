These are great ways for many to converse with others quickly, to share information for work or personal reasons, and to share the content that we enjoy. In addition, digital devices allow us to learn from others, through the use of online courses, videos, and other educational content, which may be difficult through more traditional means. People should not necessarily fear the technology available today, for they benefit others even if they use it less frequently than most. Many people have the means to implement digital devices in their life to gain benefits from them, and I believe that they should do so while moderating it with in person interactions.\n",
