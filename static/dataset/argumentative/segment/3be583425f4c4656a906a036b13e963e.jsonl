Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?\n\nIn “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,\" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.\"\n\nDo you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?\n\n---\n\nCody J. McDavis brings up interesting points and reasons for his stance against paying athletes. However, it does not give any considerations for how the athletes out to be compensated for their performance, efforts, and the amount of time that it takes to participate in college-level sports. For participating in such sports, athletes have to juggle various obligations, including their education. They make compromises as well, as being an athlete makes it harder for them to hold a full-time, even a part-time job. At the same time, their focus lies on getting better at their sport, striving to improve to be the best they can be. A college can offer scholarships or other financial aid to athletes, but it is not a guarantee that they would be able to pay for their tuition or other costs incurred to them at a college. \n\nMcDavis also argues that his stance for keeping things the way they are would not hurt fans, university, and alumni. However, that is not necessarily true. Athletes that are not compensated for their performance and efforts can face difficulties in terms of finances, even potentially accumulate debt. Such stressors can be anxiety inducing, which ultimately affects performance. Athletes under stress and anxiety will end up performing less effectively than those that are free of such stressful occurrences in their life. All together, this compromises the perseverance of a team, which lowers their appeal to their fans, and the prestige of the university. Paying for college athletes is a small price to pay for the contributions they give to a university, and should be considered due to the positive effects it bestows on the athletes themselves.\n\nMcDavis is correct that paying athletes can lead to a discrepancy in how athletes are paid, causing a bidding war that is costly for universities to participate in and to maintain. These exorbitant prices to get the best athletes no doubt will compromise the finances of the university, which can lead to budget cuts. Some level of effort will be required to prevent such occurrences, such as paying all applicable student athletes a fair amount, that is comparable to one another. This avoids bidding wars, and lowers potential costs for universities. Athletes ought to be paid for their commitment and efforts to the sport, and that it should cover their expenses and serve as a means to prevent debt in their time at a university. To not pay them for their work, will only lower their overall performance, and it will be an injustice to the very people that make college sports what they are.\n",
