Most people, I do not believe, are like this though. If a person saw a car speeding down the road and had to choose to save a kitten, or their neighbors baby toddler... I am pretty sure most people would have the moral compass enough to save the toddler, and that's how it should be. That's a close to home example though.\n\nThere are people in 3rd world nations such as north Korea that are staving to death and being beaten to death or shot, yet people would rather donate money to save the puppies instead of trying to save the staving oppressed human beings.\n\nAnimal welfare is all good, but let us not forget, we are animals too. \n",
