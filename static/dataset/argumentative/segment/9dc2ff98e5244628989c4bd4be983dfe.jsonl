I feel rather strongly on my opinion that college athletes shouldn't be paid. I thought it was for the love of the sport. There was a time in this country when athletes were paid barely a living wage. When they simply played and competed because they loved what they were doing. When students agree to compete at the college level, it should be because they love their sport and want to contribute to their new school, first and foremost. If the student doesn't believe their new team is worth their time, unless they are getting paid, they will put in less effort and be less likely to form real bonds with team members.\n\nMany athletes at the college level are also already being paid, in a sense, in terms of scholarship money.

It is unfair to the students being paid since they will only be seen for their sport. It is unfair to students who don't have physical talent, since their will be ignored further and left out of the limelight. \n\nOne of the arguments in the article above really stuck out to me, and that had to do with schools that weren't able to pay large sums of money to get the best athletes.  That can be taken further to being unfair to the sports that are being paid less than what they are worth. Early in high school students may focus only on bettering themselves in a sport that will pay top dollar in college, and other school sports will be neglected and not get top athletes. Competition seems to rule in this country. Paying college students to play, takes the competition out of the sports all the way from high school and on. It is a disservice to other students who don't play, and it will make students less likely to appreciate a college education or to focus on their studies. \n",
