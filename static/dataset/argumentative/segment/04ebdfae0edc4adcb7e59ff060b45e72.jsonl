        "text": "What Stereotypical Characters Make You Cringe?\n\nWhat stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, a stereotype that makes me cringe because of how it may portray someone is the kid who gets bullied. The reason why i would say that it makes me cringe is because of how realistic it is in our lives today in regard to mental health. I just think about what it has to do to a kids mind being picked in everyday when they go to school. They dont even get a choice whether or not to go to school, it is the law that they be there in this structured environment. An environment where they can not even trust the officials to protect them from the emotional abuse. But not only the kid being bullied, i also think about the bully themself. What drives someone to bully a kid? They must have their own mental issues as well that may need to be tended to. I would say it hits me harder while watching a movie over reading a book. You can hear more introspective thoughts while reading a book. A movie, all you see is what is on the outside unless the character is narrating themselves. So the movie is closer to reality in my opinion for that reason. I wouldnt say that i cringe out of it seeming corny to me, or being uncomfortable. But mostly a cringe just due to the fact that it makes my mind go to the people who have lost their lives from overwhelmed kids doing things like school shootings and bombs, simply because they are having trouble controlling their minds and dealing with the stress that is put on them from either being bullied, family upbringing, etc. \n\nI dont think i would ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone, unless it was blatantly trying to be racist to its audience or something like that. Normally when there is offensive portrayal of someone it is tied into the plot of the story.  If there were to be offensive portrayal of someone for no rythme or reason then it may be difficult for me to watch.  I just dont really understand or identify with that type of hateful mindset, so i would rather not watch it. I understand that people are brought up in certain ways, but to me it is almost like they are brainwashed to be hateful towards people who were born a certain way. \n",

They allow you to identify with characters and form deeper understandings of them. Also, they allow you to see people overcome their stereotype, and evolve as the story goes on just as people do in our reality.\n",
