In the United States, there are many people who struggle to afford pads and tampons and our school system can surely help meet this human need that most all women have. \nI have myself experienced period shaming. Without the right product a girl can have an accident that is evident to other students who may see this as an opportunity to humiliate someone by pointing it out to others or laughing. It's sad that young people sometimes act in this way. But, it's even sadder for the person (me) who is literally traumatized by someone \"period-shaming\" them. \nSchools should step in to help prevent this from ever occurring. And they should provide tampons and pads to the students that need them at no cost. \n",
