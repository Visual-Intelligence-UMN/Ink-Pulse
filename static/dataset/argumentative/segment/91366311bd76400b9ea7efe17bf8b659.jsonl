I think its effects have also been generally positive. The only downsides are that it can be a distraction, and it can be used to spread negativity. Checking up on a partner's social media accounts can be a good way to see if they are being honest, but it can also turn into a way to spy on them. Again, though, before social media existed, paranoid people would still check up on their partners, and it caused the same problems in relationships then, that it does now.
