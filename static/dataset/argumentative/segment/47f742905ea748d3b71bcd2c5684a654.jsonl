I don't think that they should be taught everything, because they have to learn how to learn on their own. My favorite teacher in high school was my English teacher, Mrs. Hensley. She was a great teacher, and she taught me how to be independent. She did so by giving us a lot of freedom in our writing. And moreover, she gave us a lot of freedom and independence in choosing what we wanted to write about, and even what our assignments would be. I loved her class because she was so open to what we wanted to write about, and she was very encouraging. I really disliked my teachers who boxed me into a certain type of writing, and I didn't like it when they told me what to write about. I never felt like I got much out of their classes because they were so restrictive.\n\nAfter all, now that I've graduated from school, I have to be independent. When my boss tells me to do something, I have to be able to do it on my own. I have to be able to think for myself, and I have to be able to take instructions and figure out a way to execute on them. Realistically speaking, I have to be able to do this in order to succeed in life. So it's a real shame that some teachers don't teach their students how to be independent. Some teachers are so restrictive that they don't let their students think for themselves.  For example, I had a teacher in high school who was so restrictive that she wouldn't let us use the word \"I\" in our writing. She said that we had to use the word \"one\" instead. Silly , right?\n",

I don't think that they should be taught everything, because they have to learn how to learn on their own. My favorite teacher in high school was my English teacher, Mrs. Hensley.

And moreover, she gave us a lot of freedom and independence in choosing what we wanted to write about, and even what our assignments would be. I loved her class because she was so open to what we wanted to write about, and she was very encouraging. I really disliked my teachers who boxed me into a certain type of writing, and I didn't like it when they told me what to write about. I never felt like I got much out of their classes because they were so restrictive.\n\nAfter all, now that I've graduated from school, I have to be independent. When my boss tells me to do something, I have to be able to do it on my own. I have to be able to think for myself, and I have to be able to take instructions and figure out a way to execute on them. Realistically speaking, I have to be able to do this in order to succeed in life. So it's a real shame that some teachers don't teach their students how to be independent. Some teachers are so restrictive that they don't let their students think for themselves.  For example, I had a teacher in high school who was so restrictive that she wouldn't let us use the word \"I\" in our writing. She said that we had to use the word \"one\" instead. Silly, right?

Mrs. Hensley didn't let us slack off in class; she just let us choose the assignments we wanted to work on. For example, I could choose to write a paper on the Civil War, or I could choose to write a paper on the history of the automobile. Both of these assignments would require me to develop a thesis and a body of evidence to support my thesis.

I really disliked my teachers who boxed me into a certain type of writing, and I didn't like it when they told me what to write about. I never felt like I got much out of their classes because they were so restrictive.\n\nAfter all, now that I've graduated from school, I have to be independent. When my boss tells me to do something, I have to be able to do it on my own. I have to be able to think for myself, and I have to be able to take instructions and figure out a way to execute on them. Realistically speaking, I have to be able to do this in order to succeed in life. So it's a real shame that some teachers don't teach their students how to be independent. Some teachers are so restrictive that they don't let their students think for themselves.  For example, I had a teacher in high school who was so restrictive that she wouldn't let us use the word \"I\" in our writing. She said that we had to use the word \"one\" instead. Silly, right? That's a kind of rule that I think is ridiculous. If I'm turning on my thinking cap and getting my creative juices flowing, I don't want to be told that I can't use the word \"I.\" It's just a dumb rule.\n\nIn general, I think that the independence that Mrs. Hensley taught me in high school has helped me a lot in my life. And in the future, I think that it will help me a lot, too. After all, I know that as I rise in the ranks, I'll need to be able to think for myself. Mrs. Hensley didn't let us slack off in class; she just let us choose the assignments we wanted to work on. For example, I could choose to write a paper on the Civil War, or I could choose to write a paper on the history of the automobile. Both of these assignments would require me to develop a thesis and a body of evidence to support my thesis. But I really felt like I had ownership over my work when I was given the freedom to choose what I wanted to write about. And I really felt that I could do my best work when I was given the freedom to choose what I wanted to write about.\n\nSo in general, I was very happy to have learned how to be independent in high school. I never really use calculus or trigonometry, so I can't say that the actual curriculum that we are taught in high school is as important as the independence that we learn. When was the last time you used a quadratic equation? I'm sure that you can't remember. But I'm sure that you can remember the time when you were given a project to do, and you had to figure out how to do it on your own. It probably last happened just a day or so ago. \n\nIn conclusion, I think that the most important thing that students should learn in school is how to be independent.\n",
