Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, being aware of your surroundings, environment and world is important. You should be a participant, not solely someone who is passively acted upon by politics, current events, and justice.  Being passive and not participating and being aware in news is dangerous.  Regimes and dictatorships thrive on this sort of mind set and it should be shunned. Persons who simply go blindly with the crowd are the sort swept into oppression, misery, and morally bankrupt schemes. Think specifically about cults. Jim Jones, a cult leader made sure his followers couldn't participate in politics, in fact he withdrew them from the United States into a place with no real media or news, Jones Town it was called. Koolaid is what was served to those there.  They also didn't bother to find out about current events. Allowing their autonomy to be given up, families who whispered warnings were ignored. Almost everyone who followed Jones ended up as victims being poisoned or shot, or damaged forever.\n\nWe should make sure we follow news, asking questions when appropriate and listening to diverse viewpoints. It allows us to see charlatans who would possess us. It allows us to arm ourselves. The most important weapon that we hold is the vote. We should find out about candidates and policies and vote for those that are fair, just, and bring humanity forward. It's all of our business to participate. It's necessary and a requirement of citizenship that we understand what is going on around us. If we don't act competently we can expect to be herded like cattle.\n",
