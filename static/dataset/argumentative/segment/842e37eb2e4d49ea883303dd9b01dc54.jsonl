Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. \n",

There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media. You really get to understand what causes the character to act like that more often than you do in movies. I can really feel like i become a character when i read books just because of how often i feel i am in their thoughts. I learn a lot about myself and also learn alot about different situations people can go through. A great movie can do this as well, and sometimes hits me even stronger if done in the right way simply because of the visual appeal added on. \n",

So in conclusion, i feel stereotypes can be what makes or breaks a movie in a way. Characters are super important in any type of story, and limiting a character to only one stereotype without any depth seems to me like a recipe for disaster.\n",
