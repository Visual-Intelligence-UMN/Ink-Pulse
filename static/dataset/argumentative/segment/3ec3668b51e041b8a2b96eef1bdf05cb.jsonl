Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.\n\nWhy do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, it is important to recognize and address both animal and human suffering. We must look closely not only at the suffering, but at the people that cause suffering. For example, the things that trigger someone to hurt a person are different than the things that would trigger someone to harm an animal. Humans use animals for labor, torture, and medical research. While with people, they usually suffer because of emotional reasons, revenge, etc. I noticed that in the real world, many people who abuse humans have been abused as well. So instead of focusing on if animal rights are not important as human rights, we should learn more about the violent people and ways to intervene.  For example, I know that if a child has been abused at home, he or she is most likely to physically hurt others when they grow up. Early intervention is key. Educating children about violence is another great way. Looking for early warning signs is important. The treatment of the home environment is key and can tell a lot about the future behaviors of someone. Maybe violence towards animals and humans is not so different, but I totally understand why people are more concerned about preventing human abuse. In conclusion, I strongly believe that animal abuse is a warning sign that someone will do the same to humans as well. It's not always the other way around. \n",

No one should be criticized for wanting to help one more than the other. Help is help, and is always needed. \n",
