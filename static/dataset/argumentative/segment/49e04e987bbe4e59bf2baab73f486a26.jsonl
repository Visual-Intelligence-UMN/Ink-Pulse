Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest.

That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. \n",
