One method maybe be better than the other in a specific situation, but overall, each contributes to  education, learning, and entertainment in a unique, but equally beneficial fashion.\n\nI listen to audiobooks when I'm doing something else, like driving, walking, or working out.   I find it easier to listen to a book than read it, because I can do something else at the same time. I don't have to concentrate on reading, and I can listen to the book in the background. \n\nAudiobooks are great when your hands are preoccupied, situations where you couldn't hold or read a traditional book.   I have listened to audiobooks while doing dishes, cleaning, and even working out.  Audiobooks while cooking and commuting to work are part of my daily routine. \n\nAudiobooks also can be used by children who cannot read the traditional books yet, or the visually impaired.   Audiobooks are also great for people who are learning a second language.\n\nTraditional book reading though, has its own place in my heart.   I love the feel of a book, the smell of the pages, and the ability to highlight and make notes in the margins.   \n\nI love the ability to read a book at my own pace, and not have to worry about missing something if I stop listening.   I also love the ability to read a book in bed, and not have to worry about falling asleep with my headphones on, or charging a battery. \n\nI think both methods of reading have their place, and I enjoy both.   I think the best way to read a book is the way that works best for you.\n",

I love the feel of a book, the smell of the pages, and the ability to highlight and make notes in the margins.   There is a sense of permanence and ownership that is exhilarating. I feel a sense of connection with the author, one that is not present in audiobooks. \n\nRelaxing with a good book is an experience.  You can get comfortable, curl up in a beanbag, without getting overstimulated, or needing an electronic device like an audiobook needs. \n\nI love the ability to read a book at my own pace, and not have to worry about missing something if I stop listening.
