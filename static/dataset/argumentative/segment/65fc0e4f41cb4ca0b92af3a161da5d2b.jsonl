I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.\n\nI currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers.\n",

What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.\n\nI currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.\n\nIn conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know.\n",

These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.\n\nIn conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car?\n",
