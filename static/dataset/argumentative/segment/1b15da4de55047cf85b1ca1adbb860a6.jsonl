If not, why not?\n\nHow do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, technology has had a positive affect on romantic relationships.  Technology allows us to communicate with our significant other no matter where we are in the world. Inventions such as FaceTime allow for long distance relationships to not feel so distant.\n\nTechnology has also given us dating apps and websites such as Tinder and Bumble where many people have met their boyfriend, girlfriend, wife or husband. These apps help take the stress and anxiety away from meeting someone for the first time. You can ease into a \"relationship\" by talking online with someone first. \n\nThis allows you to get to know someone and get information on whether you are most likely compatible with them or not. \n\nTechnology has personally helped me when it comes to dating. I have used Tinder a couple of times and actually found my current girlfriend on there. I feel like it's a very easy way to break the ice and let someone know that you're interested in them. All you have to do is swipe right and they know you're at least interesting in speaking to them.\n\nTo me, technology takes a lot of the nerves away from dating. I have been on first dates before where I was very nervous and a lot of that is because I didn't really know the other person. I was going to have to do everything in person which can be a bit hard. You don't want to say the wrong thing as that can tank the entire date.\n\nTechnology allows us to text, call, send pictures, use dating apps, use FaceTime, Zoom, etc. There are so many dating benefits that come with it. \n\nI also think a hidden benefit of technology when it comes to dating is the ability of taking a picture or a video. This may not come across as a benefit to everyone but catching someone cheating via picture or video is evidence that can't be argued against.\n\nSo while a relationship may end because of that and it will hurt one party badly, I still think it's a benefit. Who wants to date someone that isn't being faithful? I know people who have been in relationships in the past who suspect something is going on but don't want to believe it. When there is hard evidence, there is nothing the other person can do. So technology not only helps establish positive relationships, it also can end negative ones where one party is being taken advantage of.\n\nTechnology has helped the dating scene and continues to help relationships on a daily basis.\n\n",
