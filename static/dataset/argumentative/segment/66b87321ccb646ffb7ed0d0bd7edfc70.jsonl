He said that man was to rule over all animals and use them as man sees fit. It is not just wrong its evil to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we should be focusing on helping people. We used animal's as food, clothing and occasionally entertainment, they are ours to use as we wish. So we should not worry about them when millions of babies are being murdered every few months or sold for cloning. We have people in America who are starving, but working full time but have to give all their money to the government. We need to fix that before fixing nature and animals. Once we get rid of all the trouble makers and restart the country, then maybe we will talk about animals being treated a little better.  \nThe animals just need to stand around and eat sometimes, they dont have to deal with the Democrats and illegal aliens.  If the animals had our problems then maybe I would feel bad for them but they just eat up our natural resources and they act like there's not such thing as Twitter and Facebook and how patriots are not being systematically erased from existence. \nSo no, I do not think animals should get any extra treatment until humans get their act together and get back to normal.\n",
