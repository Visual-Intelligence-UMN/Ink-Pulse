I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs.

There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or \"making the move\" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.\n\n\n",
