How so?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is no pressure to answer or make conversation.\n",

As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.\n\nOf course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.\n\nI have not \n",
