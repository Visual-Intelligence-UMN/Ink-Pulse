What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, many of the subjects in school are not directly related to someones life. I would look at high school more of a way to prepare young adults for their future and life on their own as opposed to preparing them for college. All the more advanced types of maths and sciences arent all that beneficial to many of the lives of students, especially those who plan on working after graduation. The classes i feel should be implemented more often stem around life skills, and mental health. I believe there should be an entire class on finances in my opinion. An entire marking period or semester spent on credit, one spent on investing and saving, one spent on debt and saving, etc. Just more life skills over the general education types of courses. Not only this but i think nutrition should be taught in a much more in depth way. I think itd be a great idea to teach about foods as a way to heal your body, like medicine. This can tie into mental health. Instead of looking for drugs to feel better and less anxious, how about trying some magnesium. Maybe eating a higher fat diet will slow your mind down anxiety wise, eating more pastured eggs, or nutritious foods like raw milk, organ meats, fatty fish, etc. The most important thing i learned in school personally had nothing to do with any of my classes. The thing i learned was simply about myself and how i interact with other people. I was often uncomfortable in school because i was being forced to act a certain way in a classroom full of kids. I learned that i was insecure in certain ways, and confident in certain ways. It helped my future because i knew where i needed to grow personally, and i realized what i could do to help myself through my own research. I think the best thing about school is the environment, and the helpful people you meet and can learn from.  \n",

I think the worst things are the forced agenda, the tests and the stress involved with all of it. The school system is very structured and for people who are outliers and different it can really harm their minds. I grew up with ADHD, so i always viewed this as a crutch growing through school because i was different and disabilitied in that environment.  I now view it as an asset as i am able to focus on what i am interested in much more than the average person, and this allows me to become great at different things i set my mind to. These are my thoughts on modern day schools and classes.\n",
