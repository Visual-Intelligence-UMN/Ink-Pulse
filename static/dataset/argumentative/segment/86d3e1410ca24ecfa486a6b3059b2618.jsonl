If not, why not?\n\nHow do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?\n\n---\n\nFor the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. \n\nI think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways. For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in. Technology has helped people to meet others, to find those with similar interests or values to them, and has had other benefits to romantic interactions.\n\nIn my opinion, technology has not worsened dating and relationships. It has had an overall positive impact on dating, and I do not believe that it will be lessened or removed in the near future. I believe technology will continue to improve and become more effective, which could mean that dating apps will become better at getting people together, for the type of romantic relationship they may want to pursue. In addition, technology has allowed people to be more open and communicative in their romantic relationships, and allows people to share their thoughts with others allowing such relationships to continue and deepen over time. While some might still benefit through not using technology for dating as much as others, the presence of technology ought to be considered in embraced in modern society, in terms of the benefits it offers in maintaining relationships with one another.\n",
