I believe that this is a personal decision that should be left up to the individual. If a student is experiencing period poverty, they should be able to purchase pads and tampons from the school store at a lower price but for a limited quota. Pads and tampons are only used by female students, so if they are provided for free, it is unfair to the male students. In my opinion, free stuff from school should be provided equally to all the students, but not just a portion of it. But if a student has financial difficulty, they may ask the school for financial help in order to get enough supply of pads and tampons. Supplying the sanitary stuff free to just financially constrained students sounds more acceptable than providing them to all the female students, as they are not similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools. In addition, students in poverty can apply for government aids to satisfy their daily needs including getting those sanitary stuff. To conclude, schools should not be required to provide free pads and tampons to students.\n",
