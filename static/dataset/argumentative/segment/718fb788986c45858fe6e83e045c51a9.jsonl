The young reader can listen to the words in their own voice and that of the narrator's, making them feel more comfortable with spoken language. It also enables them to read along with each character. Audiobooks encourage children to join the book themselves by creating character voices, moving their lips as the characters move theirs, and sneaking a peek at the pictures whenever the scene changes!\n\nAudiobooks are accessible. Any book in the library may be obtained as an audiobook, and there is no waiting list. \nAudiobooks are also considerably less expensive than print books. A popular print book can cost $15-$20 at the library or other bookstore, but a popular audiobook costs less than $10. There are also numerous free audiobooks in various formats available through our public library. \n\nAudiobooks allow you to consume more printed material and explore more subjects than you would otherwise. For example, you might read a magazine article or other short text in your own time, but with audiobooks you can consume a much broader topic while you're doing something else. You could be listening to a book on beekeeping while you're driving to work, and in the process learn audibly about other books and current issues. \n\nAudiobooks make an excellent gift, and can be a great tool for personal growth. The level of character detail, enhanced storytelling, ease of access, and flexibility of Audiobooks make them the clear winner!\n",
