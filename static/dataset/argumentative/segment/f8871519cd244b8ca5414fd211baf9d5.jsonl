However, the consequences of paying student athletes should be considered by colleges, and care must be taken to better handle its finances. Ideally, student athletes should be equally paid regardless of performance or notoriety. This avoids many colleges from starting bidding wars to get the best athletes, and or spending too much to pay for its athletes at the cost of other cutbacks.  The pay offered to athletes should accommodate their school and personal needs, being equivalent to a full-time job that other students may hold. They should still be provided the opportunities of scholarships and grants, to help them continue their education, and avoid going into debt.\n",
