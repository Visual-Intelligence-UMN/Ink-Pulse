        "text": "How Do You Think Technology Affects Dating?\n\nHave you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?\n\nHow do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, dating apps and technology in general have paved the way to bridge closer connections together than ever before. Because of dating apps such as Tinder, Facebook , Instagram, Snapchat, and other social media platforms, people are able to connect with each other in ways that were not possible before. Imagine before where two strangers could only meet by chance on a particular instance, nowadays we are able to connect with people from all over the world. It's almost as if it's cheating to find the one and what most people call, your soulmate.\n\nOf course being too distracted and neglecting to spend time with your loved ones if you use these dating apps too often can be a negative. But so is anything else that you do in excess. So the usage of technology must come with a great balance and moderation. This way, you can still enjoy the benefits of technology while still being able to maintain a healthy relationship with your significant other.\n\nI remember being a kid and having no internet in the house, in order for me to contact a loved one that is far away is to write a letter and send it through snail mail. It was a slow, expensive, and a time consuming process. We almost take it for granted today that we can send a message to someone in another country in a matter of seconds that is also free of cost, considering you already have the equipment to do so. I feel like in the future, it would just be improved and we would all feel very connected more than less.\n\nBeing in a video call or a phone call, something may seem missing. It's not the same as being in person. Being intimate and feeling the touch of someone is still something that the technology can give. That's why I am optimistic that in the future, this can be improved and we can have a more intimate connection with each other. Having a device that lets you feel the touch of someone is something that I would like to see in the future. That way, there's no need for you to be in the same room as someone in order to feel their touch. This eliminates the issue of having to travel long distances just to see someone.\n\nSo just to clarify my stance with technology and dating apps, I feel like they are a bridge instead of a barrier.\n",
