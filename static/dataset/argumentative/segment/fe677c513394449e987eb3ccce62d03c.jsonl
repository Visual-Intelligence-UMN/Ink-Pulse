        "text": "Is It Selfish to Pursue Risky Sports Like Extreme Mountain Climbing?\n\nSome sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.\n\nThese activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them. It is our infrastructure that is put to the test when something goes wrong. Communities to not sacrifice resources to build hospitals, roads and emergency systems for this purpose. The cost falls on all of us.\n\nPersonal freedom is important, and most would agree that it is central to American life.
