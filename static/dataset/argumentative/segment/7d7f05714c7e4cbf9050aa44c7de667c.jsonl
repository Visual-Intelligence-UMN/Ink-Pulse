If you know more about current events, especially in your own community, it's much easier to start a conversation with a stranger. It also helps when another person wants to start a conversation with you, for you to have some idea of topics they may talk about. The world around us, in a way, is the thing that connects us, so this common knowledge is vital, especially in a democratic society.\nI also thing that engaging with current events can help communities by addressing the needs of the less fortunate. Only by communicating with one another can people get involved with helping others in their area. \nThe benefits of keeping up with the news are numerous. However, a population that is uninformed would be without these benefits. It is for this reason that I believe that it is necessary to keep up with the news, and yes, we are being bad citizens if we do not. \n",
