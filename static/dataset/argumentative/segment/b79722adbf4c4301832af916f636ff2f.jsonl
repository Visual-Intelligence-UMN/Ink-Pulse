Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, there are many benefits that come from using an audiobook. The first benefit that I think of is that we can listen to a book when it's dark. We can't read a book in the dark and if we try, we actually are doing damage to our eye sight.\n\nYou also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.\n\nAudiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road. \n\nI do think that there are benefits to having a physical book as well. The main benefit is simply just having the book in your hands. Something just feels right when I am holding a book and reading it. Maybe it's something my brain is just comfortable with.\n\nI find the audiobook version helps me retain information better as well. I struggle a bit when reading to fully take in what I'm reading. I read very fast and a lot of times I'll finish a chapter without really understanding what I just read. I for whatever reason learn better when I hear the information out loud. I typically listen to audiobooks late at night. I don't have any distractions at that point so I can concentrate best.\n\nI personally prefer my books to be audiobooks. I find the benefits really help me understand the book better than if I were to read it the traditional way. So audiobooks have really helped me in my life. Without them, I wouldn't \"read\" much at all.\n\n",
