I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me.\n",

I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared.

I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared.

They are totally different from Band-Aids, toilet paper, soap and other things that are already provided in schools. I mean, pads and tampons are not a necessity. They're not like food or water. They're not even like toilet paper. We all need toilet paper universally but not everyone needs pads and tampons. And moreover, not every girl needs pads and tampons all the time because periods only come once a month. So really, it's not that big of a deal. I mean, girls can just use toilet paper if they don't have any pads or tampons. And if they're really desperate, they can just use a sock or something. I have heard of socks being absorbent. I mean, it's not like they're going to bleed to death or anything. \n\nWhen it comes down to it, I don't really want to have to subsidize the cost of pads and tampons for girls.

I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.\n\nI just don't see any reason why pads and tampons should be free. They are totally different from Band-Aids, toilet paper, soap and other things that are already provided in schools. I mean, pads and tampons are not a necessity. They're not like food or water. They're not even like toilet paper. We all need toilet paper universally but not everyone needs pads and tampons. And moreover, not every girl needs pads and tampons all the time because periods only come once a month. So really, it's not that big of a deal. I mean, girls can just use toilet paper if they don't have any pads or tampons. And if they're really desperate, they can just use a sock or something. I have heard of socks being absorbent. I mean, it's not like they're going to bleed to death or anything. \n\nWhen it comes down to it, I don't really want to have to subsidize the cost of pads and tampons for girls. I mean, it's not my responsibility. So I don't want my taxes to go toward buying pads and tampons for girls. And I certainly wouldn't want my parents to have to pay extra taxes just so that girls can have free pads and tampons. That would be some serious BS. If girls need pads and tampons, then they should just get a job and buy them for themselves. We all need to budget our money and be responsible. We shouldn't \n",
