The best way to do that is figure out what stereotype fits the profile of the person spouting off and turn it against him and use it against him.  I guarantee it will fire him up and he'll be denying most if not all about what you are pronouncing as the truth about him.  It can be based on gender, age, looks, skin color, religion, political stance, size of his feet, hands, nose, head, his height, or lack thereof, educational level, income level, clubs, favorite food and drink, anything at all.  It's not hard to figure out one that will fit or even a combination that will. \n\nHopefully, after that exercise the perpetrator will come to his senses and engage in some reflection that will will improve him as a human being.  No guarantee, but I'd say there is at least an even chance that it will.  \n\n\n",
