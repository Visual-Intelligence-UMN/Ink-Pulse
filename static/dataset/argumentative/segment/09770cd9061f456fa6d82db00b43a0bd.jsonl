A stereotyped character is a kind of lazy short-cut, used by a writer who has no real faith in their own work. I don't like those types of creators, so I typically avoid their work, whether it is in books, games, movies, or television. So, my experience with these kinds of characters is limited.\n\nHowever, some of the characters I've encountered that made me cringe that readily spring to mind include Harry Potter, Rey from the recent Star Wars films, and Abby from The Last of Us 2. Harry Potter 's portrayal as a wide-eyed twit who has to be saved by everyone else, succeeds without without any particular effort on his part but instead through his status as a 'chosen one'  was particularly eye-roll inducing; I always rooted against him, and I've avoided every Harry Potter movie since the first. Star Wars: The Force Awakens ' Rey is a straight up Mary Sue, with no particular flaws or accomplishments. She proceeds through the stories in a similar way to Harry Potter, and these are basically male and female versions of the exact same type of stereotypical 'chosen one' character.\n\nAbby from The Last of Us was an unmitigated pile of skunk crap who did nothing but steal food, push equally stereotypical girls out of the way\n",
