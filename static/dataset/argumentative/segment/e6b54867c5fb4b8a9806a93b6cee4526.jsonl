There are numerous stats proving that our country has a history of using the law to overcriminalize black males and to give them harder sentences on average than white males doing the same crimes. Filmmakers should really know better than make these types of characters come to life in a movie in a way that makes it seem common, when that is so far from the truth. \nIn sum, seeing the black male criminal stereotype on the big screen makes me cringe more than any other because I know that overuse of these characters has had a negative impact on society and it's downright wrong.\n",
