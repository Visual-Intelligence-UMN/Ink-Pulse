You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever.

It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.\n\n\n",

You don't have to keep up with celebrity news to be a citizen. However, you need to keep up with what is happening in the world. If that feels overwhelming, you at least need to know what is happening in your very own country. That is the only way you can make informed decisions. Because otherwise you are just blindly making decisions that not only have the potential to harm yourself but also your neighbors, friends and even your very own family. \n",
