There are four benefits to monitoring and curating screen time: health, safety, performance and academic achievement. Let's look at each in turn. \n\nWe'll start with health - because it is the most important. We can make use of the online fitness classes to exercise at home, which is very flexible and self-paced. The absence of physical contact also prevents the spread of infection. \n\nRegarding safety, screen time can connect us and help us monitor our homes, our children and the elderly who cannot get out. \n\nFor workers, they can work from home with screen time, while staying with their family.\n\nEducation is another area of benefit. Many students can now learn at home via screen time. And universities' distance-learning programs can be supplemented with screen time. Finally, screen time can also help in academic achievement by providing the learners with the necessary tools to explore knowledge. \n\nTo conclude, we shall get over the excessive screen use and embrace the benefits of our digital devices. \n",
