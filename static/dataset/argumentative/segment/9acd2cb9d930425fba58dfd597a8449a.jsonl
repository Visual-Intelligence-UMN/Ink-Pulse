        "text": "What Stereotypical Characters Make You Cringe?\n\nWhat stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, stereotypes by themselves are not always harmful, as they are simply a shortcut that people make when they do not have enough information about an individual.  However, even though they are not intended to be harmful, they often can be, especially to the person who is being judged.  \n\nI cringe when I see a character that is a stereotype because it makes me feel like the author is lazy, but I also feel that this use of stereotyping might end up being harmful to the group that the author is writing about.  For example, if an author writes about black youths who end up committing crimes, this would further strengthen society's expectations that young black males are violent, and this will lead others not to trust them.  Clearly, this is not right, because crime comes from poverty, not from race.  \n\nI was fortunate in life to have been born a white male, which gives me definite advantages.  However, if I was a member of a minority group, I would prefer not to watch or read something that is offensive to me, because I would feel like the author is being disrespectful to me.  I would also feel that I was rewarding this conduct on the part of authors and screenwriters, which would further encourage it.  \n\nAs a member of the majority, though, I do still cringe when I see minority groups portrayed in an insensitive, stereotypical fashion on TV, in movies, and to a lesser extent in books.

Someone might assume that a young Asian person is smart, especially at math, or that someone who wears glasses is a good student.

These are all stereotypes that appear from time to time in fictional characters, and I have to object to them as well.\n\nI generally do not have a severe negative reaction to these stereotypes, because I do not see any acute harm that comes from them, but they are still lazy.
