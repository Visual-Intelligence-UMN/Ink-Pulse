I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. \n",

Some people do not like the idea of listening to someone else read the book to them. Some people also just prefer the traditional way of reading as it is a relaxing hobby in general. People could feel that it is easier to immerse yourself into a book when you are reading on your own. I know that our kids do better with assigned readings when they can get the audiobook version. Seems to be easier to break the procrastination when you can simply press play and listen to the book. I am mostly a fan of the audiobooks simply because it allows me to get more done around the house and in my life. I would pretty much always prefer the audiobook over the book personally. I would rather lay down and close my eyes and listen to a book over sitting in a chair with the book open. I can even get up ad go to the bathroom if need be. I also love the ability to listen to the audiobooks when exercising. Going on jogs and listening to audiobooks is much more entertaining than i ever realized. In conclusion, i feel listening to a book is just as good as reading one.\n",
