We can overcome obstacles as long as we aren't ashamed to discuss this topic. It's not taboo. Schools can have open meetings to discuss it yearly so it eventually just becomes a normal, boring school topic. Just like the nurse's office, bathrooms, books and pencils. Treat it like anything else and it won't be such a big deal anymore. I think that is the key to making sure that tampons are provided to all girls who need them. If we can provide toilet paper, then we should provide tampons. \n",
