This is not a case of a well with limited water but of a capacity for love that can only be strengthened through use. Therefore, we should commend people for caring for animals. It's important to remember that many animals that now exist were basically created, in their current form, by humans. Thus we have a responsibility for their wellbeing.

If humans stopped caring for animals we would not compensate by caring more for other people. On the contrary, our overall empathy would decline dangerously. \n",
