Rather than it being thought of as something like toilet paper, it brings up a sense of anxiety in even talking about such things for many people. \n\n\n",

When you start requiring something is when you bring too much attention to it. People get outraged and will fight it. Leaving it optional sadly will not help everyone since more conservative schools would not participate. However, it would still allow many young girls to have access who otherwise wouldn't have before. \n\nI believe that money could be put aside for it, though I'm not sure if it would have to be pulled from other areas or departments.

It is important though so it needs to be done. Maybe changing the way people think about such would help. If we can educate people that it's no different than a band-aid then it could be available in any medical kit at school or nurses office. I think that would be the best way of going about this. \n\nIn general I believe schools should carry free pads and tampons. For that to happen though, funding will not be the only issue. We need to change the perception of what such items really are and that they are medically related. That way people will more easily embrace the concept and it will over time just become the new normal in our school systems.\n",
