We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.\n\nBut should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. \n\nThe real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens. The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. \n\nWe saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing. \n\nIt's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time. Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world.
