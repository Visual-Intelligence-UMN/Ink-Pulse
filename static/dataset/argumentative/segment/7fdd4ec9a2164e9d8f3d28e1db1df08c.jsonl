I personally feel that it is less problematic to not pay college athletes and for this reason i would side with not paying them. However, i think the root of the problem just comes with the large amount of money schools make off of these college athletes. NCAA is one of the highest payed organizations in the world, and much of this is because they dont have to pay their athletes. This makes people refer to the athletes almost like they are being taken advantage of. I understand the perspective of the athlete being taken advantage of, however they are still given the platform to demonstrate their skills, and also given the opportunity to play in front of large crowds and meet tons of people, and build a following on social media. Many perks come with being a college athlete aside from just possibly being paid. The free tuition is nice for the athlete, however i dont know how much paying the athletes would be helpful. Would they be paid based off of talent, or just a flat fee? If it was a flat fee, the athletes would probably want more anyway if they were the star players. I am personally a former college football player as well, and I just feel that it is not necessary to pay the players. I think it would be nice to have more in place for the athletes, but not necessarily just a pay check. I know there are some athletes who can barely afford college and food while being there. This is unexceptable to me if they are part of a team making that much money for the university. I would treat it like a job and simply provide the best working conditions for athletes that do a lot to help the school run. No student athlete at all should have to worry about getting food to eat, or having a place to stay. \n",
