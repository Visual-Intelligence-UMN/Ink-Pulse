The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. \n\nSoeurette was a friend of mine from high school. We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. \n",

The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. \n\nSoeurette was a friend of mine from high school. We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. \n\nSoeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing. Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. \n\nSoeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together. This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. \n\nI was devastated when I heard about this. I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. \n\nBecause of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport.
