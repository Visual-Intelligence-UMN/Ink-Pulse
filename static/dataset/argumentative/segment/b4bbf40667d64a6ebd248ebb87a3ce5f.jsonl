What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. \n\nThe students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. \n\nThe scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.\n\nObviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves. \n\nTo me, that is a disgusting practice. There is enough money to go around for everyone. Imagine being an athlete like Lebron James in college and not being able to make money off of your own name and likeness.\n\nThe scholarship argument doesn't hold weight. Non-monetary perks don't hold weight. The only difficult I can think of regarding students getting paid is them not knowing how to manage their money. A simple solution to that is to have the money held up in a bank account until they graduate or are drafted to a professional sports league. You can even put a caveat in where they have to maintain a specific GPA average or else they get fined. That would be motivation enough for them to better their academics.\n\nStudent athletes deserve to be paid. That's the bottom line.\n",
