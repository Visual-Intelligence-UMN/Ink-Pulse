A student who can't read will have difficulty learning any other subject, inside of school, or out, and a student who can't write will have difficulty communicating with others. The fundamentals of math are necessary for students to do things like balance a checkbook,  figure out how much change they should get back from a cashier, budget household expenses as an adult, and do many other things that are necessary for everyday life. Eventually they'll need an understanding of math, as working adults, to not be reliant on accountants to do their taxes.\n\nStudents need to understand world history , as well as the history of their own country, in order to understand how the world came to be the way it is today. They need to understand the basics of science in order to understand how the world works, and how to use that knowledge to their advantage, such as by understanding how to use a computer, or how to fix a car. Some knowledge of the arts is needed in order for students to appreciate the beauty of the world around them, and to be able to enjoy life.\n\nOf course, there are many other things that students need to know. They need to know how to interact with others, how to be a good citizen, and how to be a good person.
