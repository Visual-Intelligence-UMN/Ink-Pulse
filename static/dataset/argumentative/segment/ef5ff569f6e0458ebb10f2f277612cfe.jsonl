Of course, this can be said of anyone who has spent too much time behind the soft glow of a virtual world. \n\nI do not believe that there is a right canned amount of how much screen time someone should use. I do, however, believe that there are signs that a user is overindulging in screen time. Those signs include anything from distracting yourself with work, to constantly being on your phone while interacting with people in ‘real’ life. Finding reasons to get in front of a screen, when there are other options available, is a sign that a person should take a look at how much time they are spending in virtual space. \n\nBeing wary of screen time is not out of line with appreciating the benefits that our devices provide. In this modern world, we are going to need to use our screens for the practical aspects of their functionality. We need them for work, and they can be an enjoyable getaway for someone who is looking for a break from their day. I would only caution that this screen time should never become a replacement for living in the world. If it does, then I believe that you are overindulging in your screen time.\n",
