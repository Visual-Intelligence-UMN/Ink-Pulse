I felt that over time I got less nervous. It's kind of like anything. The more you do something the more confident you get. I remember my first date I actually spoke to a girl online a ton. Meeting her I was so nervous because I really liked her and felt she liked me as well. We finally met and things went pretty smoothly, much better than I was expecting considering how nervous I was. I look back at that first date and laugh because I was putting so much pressure on myself for no reason.\n\nTechnology lets us break the ice and then ultimately when you're on the date you just have to be yourself. The other person is probably just as nervous as you are. After all, nobody wants to embarrass themselves or come across negatively on a first date. Of course there are first dates that just don't go well. That's a part of life.\n \n",
