Clearly the latter.\n\nI think it's just a new medium for the same old human behavior. Imagine a nice guy who's lonely. He goes on a dating app and what does he see? A bunch of pictures of women who are 5'10\" and look like models. Or a bunch of men who look like Olympic swimmers.\n\nAnd then he sees his own picture. Does it compare? Heck, no!
