We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.\n\nBut should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.\n\nWhile our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  \"Thank God for Facebook,\" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. \n\nMy niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.\n",

We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.\n\nBut should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely.

And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  \"Thank God for Facebook,\" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people.

We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.\n\nBut should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.\n\nWhile our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  \"Thank God for Facebook,\" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. \n\nMy niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work. Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the \"real\" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. \n\nSo what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance? With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook.

It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. And on weekends, we always allow some unplugged time for family fun, be it on the golf course or playing sports. Oftentimes, we'll grill together for supper, just the four of us.

We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.\n\nBut should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.\n\nWhile our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist.
