Let's face it, the world is going straight to hell. Climate change is making the planet uninhabitable, terror groups roam swathes of the Earth virulent and unchecked, and political opportunists publish lies that weaponize the stupid. Any level-headed reading of recent news will surely convince you things are hopeless. So, why read news at all?\n\nUnfortunately, not reading the news comes with its own risks. If you don't know what's going on, things can, well, catch you by surprise. You can catch COVID if you didn't know about prevention, or can be thought a fool if you can't carry a literate conversation at an after-work party.\n\nSo what's the solution? How can you be informed without being hopeless? How can you carry a literate conversation without making yourself miserable?\n\nHere's how: develop a list of literate-sounding things to say, memorize, and deploy them. That's how most people sound intelligent at parties after all. Practice saying things like: \"I've never heard that put so well before,\" \"Yes, we live in interesting times, don't we,\" and \"That's just so interesting,\" to name just three.\n\nYou can seem to be in the know, when in reality you haven't looked at the news in decades. I mean, you'll be dead in the end anyway, and reading the news won't change that. So why not hit the retirement years worry free — or as worry free as possible anyway.\n\nIf you choose that route remember: always answer in the affirmative, it is the path of least resistance. It's much easier to say \"yes\" than to offer a dissenting opinion.\n\nJust watch people gravitate toward you, admiring smiles on their lips.\n",
