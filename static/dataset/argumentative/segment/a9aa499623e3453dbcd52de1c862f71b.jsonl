Most of all though, the isolation being caused by your personal technological devices are what is keeping most people from finding each other. The digital tools of today are replacing all real world social interaction with filtered digital interactions. I cant stress how important it is to physically interact with people, especially possible mates. There is a lot more going on besides just talking. There are chemical interactions such as pheromones that help you subconsciously choose a mate. There are countless other physical ques that we see or detect on an unconscious level that help us to find our partners. \n",
