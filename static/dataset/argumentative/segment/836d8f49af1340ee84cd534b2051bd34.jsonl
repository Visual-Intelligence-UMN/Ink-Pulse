Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools?

I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. \n",

Well maybe not soap, but definitely the other two. These are all things i find in our bathroom trashcan when i empty it, so i correlate all of them. They all also serve similar purposes in a way. Band aids are used for blood, and toilet paper is used for cleaning. The two together are sort of what a tampon or pad serves for. I find tampons to also be just as necessary as the rest of the items. \n",
