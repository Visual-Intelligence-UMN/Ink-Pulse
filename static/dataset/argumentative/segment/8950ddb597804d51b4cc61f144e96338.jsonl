That way, everyone involved would be safer. If a novice was out on a course and got in the way of an experienced snowboarder, he could cause a serious accident that the experienced snowboarder couldn't stop, no mater how expert he is. A novice is not only a danger to himself, but to all the other snowboarders around him. Making novices take lessons and barring them from snowboarding, especially around others, is only right and is best for their own safety as well as the safety of everyone else. Anyone who isn't willing to take some basic training is probably to arrogant to go out on dangerous hills alone anyway, they are more likely to injure themselves that more cautious snowboarders. \n\nIn general, safety training is best for everyone, but especially for people who don't know what they are doing. Especially in sports that can cause serious injury or death if not done correctly.\n",
