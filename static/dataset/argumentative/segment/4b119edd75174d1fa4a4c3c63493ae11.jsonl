I think if someone is focused on suffering at all than they are pretty selfless in that aspect. I think it is more of a matter of perspective. The reason why people are more sensitive to animal rights is simply because we are less desensitized to seeing animals abused over humans. We see this happening to humans so often in movies, in real life, on the news, etc. I think humans have kind of built up a shell to when they see things like this. Animal suffering however is something that is more rare to us, and this causes a greater emotional response. So for the simple reason on why people tend to focus more on animal suffering, i think it has to do with the media. Throw the media out and i think the emotional response would be closer to even or even more on the human side. I personally also would say that animals produce more of a reaction in me when i see them suffering over humans. However, if i were to see a human suffering like that in person it may be different. \n\nThe debate over whether someone would save their pet dog or a foreign tourist actually makes sense to me. Your pet is part of your family, so I would assume most people would save their pet over someone they did not know. If you have to make the choice, you would make the one that effects you the most. Saving your pet would save you from the sorrow you would face if your pet was gone. If the foreign tourist died, you would be upset for a day and then most likely be ok. You did not know the person personally, so all you are going to remember is the death itself. If you pet died, you would look back on all the memories, the love, and also the death. Not only this, but you are basically loosing a family member who you have come to care about. \n",

So tying this back to the main idea, i dont think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare even when humans are suffering. Everyone has that choice, and what they deem as more important goes strictly off of their perspective and their life in general. I could not say anyone is wrong for focusing on animal suffering. Sometimes, people may even feel like they can have more of an effect on animal suffering over human suffering. There are so many humans everywhere in different governments and demographics. Ending their suffering is really an unattainable goal in a way. So in conclusion, this is my stance on animal vs human suffering.\n",
