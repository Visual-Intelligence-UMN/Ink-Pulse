Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?\n\nIn “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,\" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.\"\n\nDo you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, paying student-athletes would not ruin college sports, at least not anymore than it has been ruined. The NCAA is a business, and the players are the product. College leagues are supposed to be amateur, but the NCAA is a billion dollar business. It functions as a recruitment organization for the NFL and NBA, and has done this for years, and it is a money-making machine. Paying student-athletes would merely be a way to pay the people going through the long, minor-league, recruitment and training process. That is, it would be a way to pay the people who are engaged in a process that amounts to a very long hiring selection period.\n\nIt's not just the leagues, and how they function as a recruitment organization for the pros, though. It's also the college teams themselves. College sports make schools tons of money. Tickets to college games are expensive, and the schools make a lot of money from selling tickets. Some of these tickets are as highly demanded as the tickets to the Super Bowl. Also, the teams indirectly bring in a lot of money through merchandise, and the sale of TV rights, and through the alumni donations that are often tied to the success of the team. It might be fair to say that at colleges with very good professional teams, the school itself, and the education it provides, are secondary to the sports team. They're kind of a parasitic entity that sponges off the revenue generated by the team (among other sources), and it's only right that the players, who are in fact, supporting the school, should get a piece of the pie.\n\nIt's not unfair to say that college sports shouldn't be a business. It's not unfair to say there's too much emphasis on them, and that they're more important to the schools than they  should be, and that education is being sacrificed for the sake of sports. It's reasonable to argue that all of this should change, and that college sports should be more about education, and less about money. But it's unreasonable to \n",
