We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.\n\nBut should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, it's a two way street when it comes to our screened devices. In one way, we can argue that the screens we have everyday make our lives easier, more entertaining, and more productive.

Is this cruel and unfair? Definitely. But is this because of an over-abundance of screen time causing the addiction and consequently the behavioral issues that we see in our youth today? It's also a possibility. That's why it's always a two-fold and multi-faceted discussion when it comes to something that can become exponentially more influential, powerful and persuasive with time.\n\nWhat I suggest is that parents, companies, and the government should step in and try to change the nature of our screen habits, before this new digital world starts overtaking the more traditional ways of life of our evolution.

Google has also implemented the \"Do Not Disturb\" feature to help you turn off your phone at night, if that's what you want to do. However, these steps are just the initial steps and the companies need to do more to ensure that we aren't getting lost in our digital world.\n\nChina's banning of people under the age of 18 from playing games is an extreme and drastic step to take, and I wouldn't want to see this type of action taken in the United States.

In one way, we can argue that the screens we have everyday make our lives easier, more entertaining, and more productive. On the other hand, too much screen usage makes our social interactions more limited and less meaningful. So it is a delicate balance of how much is too much of the ever evolving digital world, and there isn't yet a standard for how much screen time is healthy.\n\nIn recent news, China has banned children under the age of 18 from playing online games. Is this cruel and unfair? Definitely. But is this because of an over-abundance of screen time causing the addiction and consequently the behavioral issues that we see in our youth today? It's also a possibility. That's why it's always a two-fold and multi-faceted discussion when it comes to something that can become exponentially more influential, powerful and persuasive with time.\n\nWhat I suggest is that parents, companies, and the government should step in and try to change the nature of our screen habits, before this new digital world starts overtaking the more traditional ways of life of our evolution. The company, Facebook, has started removing the notifications feature on their home screen because of all the incessant distracting \"Likes\" and \"+1's\". Google has also implemented the \"Do Not Disturb\" feature to help you turn off your phone at night, if that's what you want to do. However, these steps are just the initial steps and the companies need to do more to ensure that we aren't getting lost in our digital world.\n\nChina's banning of people under the age of 18 from playing games is an extreme and drastic step to take, and I wouldn't want to see this type of action taken in the United States. Instead, a federal law to urge app makers and companies to monitor the screen habits of our youth might be more effective in preventing things like compulsive gambling, compulsive shopping, compulsive texting, and any type of addiction that leads to more unnecessary screen time.\n\nEducators and parents should also step up to ensure our kids are not losing valuable time in their development, health, and social life because they are lost within the confines of their screens. A more hands-on approach and a more sensitive level of mentorship for our youth can reduce the let-down from our digital world by introducing more hands-on experiences and personality. If you are a parent, spending more time and having activities with your kid would help them spend less time on their phones.\n\nTo recap, I never want any banning or any drastic measures for people to limit their screen time. It doesn't work and it will not deter people from not using their devices. Instead, we should talk about the nuanced, more specific and technical aspects about how to balance the modern lifestyle with the ways of our ancestors. This can be done by analyzing and studying different aspects of life like our social interaction, our health, and our cognitive ability, where all of these three aspects are intertwined. Having devices with screens will not go anytime soon, but I just hope for the sake of our survival, devices will play a more positive role in our daily routines instead of the other way around.\n",
