In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.\n\nTo a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.\n\nSo while the tendency is understandable, it overlooks certain things. Humans are animals, too, with greater capabilities than most, but still, subject to many of the same forces of nature as any other animal.\n",
