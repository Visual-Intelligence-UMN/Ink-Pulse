        "text": "Is It Wrong to Focus on Animal Welfare When Humans Are Suffering?\n\nWould you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.\n\nWhy do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.\n\nSo there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals? I would propose that the answer to this is that they are not really concerned with the suffering of animals, but rather, with their own feelings. They're incapable of caring for anyone else's feelings, human or animal. These people in fact, hate other humans, who they consider to be a distraction from the only thing that's important - themselves - and are only concerned with the suffering of animals because by bringing it up, they can re-direct the attention of others, back towards the truly important topic - them.\n\nIn short, the phenomenon of caring more for animal suffering than the plight of humans, is a form of narcissism.
