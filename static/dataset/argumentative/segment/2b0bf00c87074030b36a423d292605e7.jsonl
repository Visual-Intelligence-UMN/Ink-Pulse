I personally feel that media and news in general has the power to dictate how someone feels about different types of topics. If people watched all the news all the time, they would think the world was going to explode and probably be upset more often than not. I think having a general idea of what is going on in the world is smart, however overconsuming news could drive you mad. Not only this, but the media heavily favors the more negative and violent news because people are more prone to watch it. \n",
