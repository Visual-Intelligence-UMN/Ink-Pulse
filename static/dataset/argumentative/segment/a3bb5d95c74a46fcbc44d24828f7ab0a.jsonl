As a matter of fact, I met my wife through a dating website and app. I don't think we would have met otherwise. We both had the same interests and hobbies, and we were both looking for someone to share our lives with. So we found each other, dated for awhile, and ended up getting married a couple of years later. Still happy also. \n\nOther technology can also have a great impact on any type of relationship also. Every sit back on the couch at night with your sweet heart and just relax while watching Netflix? Yup, that's using technology in your relationship. It can also help you understand your partner better as well. Maybe you want to surprise your partner with a gift. Get out your smartphone and order it online from Amazon or something. Again, technology just made your life a little easier. \n\nTechnology can also be a great way to keep in touch with your partner. Through messaging apps you can still communicate while away from each other, to let each other know you both still care.\n\nI think technology has a great impact on dating, and relationships in general. I support it.\n",
