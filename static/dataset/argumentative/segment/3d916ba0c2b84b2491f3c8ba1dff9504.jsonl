I know that we have a lot of paid subscriptions that we pay already, but for people that are willing to pay to use the app, they might as well pay a little more so that we don't have to be bombarded with ads.\n\nSecond is to make the experience more personal. Have the users do more of the work, such as writing an introduction or even suggesting that we write our own Instagram-type profile with our photos. Videos, as well as other personal information such as our relationship statuses is also helpful in dating apps. Remember when we were able to listen to music when we visit someone else's Myspace page? I think that needs to come back.\n\nAnd my last point, is to decrease the overall usage from these dating apps. Technology is a great tool to find someone you're interested with, but it can be a detrimental factor in relationships. If we are too distracted with technology and have no time to spend with the person we were just matched, then there is no point of having technology in the first place.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I think technology and the dating apps are helpful in finding great and lasting relationships, but \n",
