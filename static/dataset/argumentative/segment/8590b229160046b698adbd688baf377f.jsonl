It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.\n\n\n",

Find out what things affect you directly and involve force upon ways to improve that outcome. It will pay off if you focus. Knowing is almost always better than ignorance. Getting answers is better than only having questions. Light is better than darkness and knowledge is brought about by paying attention to the news and involving yourself in change.\n",
