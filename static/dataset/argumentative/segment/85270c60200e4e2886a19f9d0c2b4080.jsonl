Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, listening to an audiobook is just as good as reading it. Audiobooks have opened up new worlds for me. I used to be a very slow reader, and I would often get bored with a book and not finish it. But with audiobooks, I can listen to a book while I'm doing other things, and I don't get bored. It helps me to get through books that I might not have finished otherwise. I feel more connected to the characters when I listen to an audiobook, and I feel like I'm really there with them. \n\nI think listening to an audiobook is just as good as reading it. It is less taxing on the eyes. It is less mentally fatiguing to be read to than it is to be alert enough to read. One nice thing about audiobooks is being able to have ones eyes closed. We can listen to music with our eyes closed, but not reading books.  That is one of the most relaxing things I can do. Another benefit  is you can enjoy the sound of the narrator's voice. It is like listening to a friend tell a story and adds the level of entertainment that doesn't exist with reading paper books. Books are silent. In the end, \n",
