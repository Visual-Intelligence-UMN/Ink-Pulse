Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, all female students should have access to free tampons and pads via a discreet way of distribution. I think that we should be doing everything we possibly can to make our students as comfortable as humanly possible. If that means distributing pads and tampons for female students, we should do that.\n\nI can only imagine what it would be like as a female student and forgetting to bring a pad or a tampon one day. I think we all understood that it would be embarrassing for the student to speak up or tell someone about that. I can only imagine the anxiety and stress. \n\nWe really should set something up in schools that allow a female student to go to the nurse and receive these items for free. There shouldn't be any stress behind it. Zero embarrassment as well as the nurse was once a 16-17 year old female student as well.\n\nWhen it comes to soap, paper towels and toilet paper...I really don't see much of a difference when compared to tampons and pads. They are all items that are there to help us regarding our personal hygiene. I understand that those items are only used by females but that shouldn't matter at all.\n\nIf anything we should be going above and beyond to make sure our female students are comfortable in school. School is basically a child's second home.  It is our school and our government's responsibility to ensure that our female students can get these items.\n\nWithout that in place, we're really making school a difficult place for female students to be. I'm sure most females at one point in their life have misplaced a tampon or simply forgotten to bring one. I think that's normal for basically everyone to have forgotten an item that they're supposed to bring to school.\n\nLets make school more comfortable for female students. We owe it to them.\n",
