Remote work would have been mostly impossible for many.  Online shopping impossible.  Keeping up with others would have involved long periods of delay and intimacy would have suffered.  Schooling would have been limited to what is in a book with no ready explanations or fun games to assist.  \n",

Many places in Australia do their schooling via radio and have for years, with screens it's much better than that.  We just need to adapt and get on with it because I'm convinced screens are here to stay very much present.\n",
