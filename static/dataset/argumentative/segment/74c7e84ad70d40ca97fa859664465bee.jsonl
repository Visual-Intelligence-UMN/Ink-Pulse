Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, excessive screen use is always going to be a problem in our society whether it is a pandemic or not. I think that since screens are simply a part of our lives now, it really only depends on how it is used. I would say that the majority of people without a doubt abuse it, however there are some that use it an extremely productive ways. I think that during the pandemic specifically, social media and screens is really the only thing that made us feel connected. Without social media, i think the pandemic would have felt a lot more lonely. We would have felt like we were living in the early 20th century or something like that. I think this would have made people go crazy. People would have been fighting over resources and fending for their lives like it was an apocolypse simply because it is so different to how we live today. So overall to me social media is what helped the pandemic a lot, but of course with any positive comes a negative. Social media also caused a lot of depression and mental issues. People would see others and be upset that they could not spend time with them, or see people doing fun things and feel like their life is super monotonous. \n",

I think it should be embraced, but also used in moderation. People abuse it and then wonder why they feel awful. Social media is a hotspot for comparing your lives to the lives of other people. It is very difficult to be content with your own life if you are always watching the highlight reel of others lives. If used in moderation, i think you would give your chance more of an opportunity to experience these things and realize that your life is pretty great as well. \n",

So in conclusion, i think screens have won in a way, and we should embrace them. We just need to be sure that we are aware that too much of anything can be bad, and if we overuse these sort of tools than we are only setting ourselves up for failure. I wouldnt even be opposed to schools having classes on different ways to use modern day technology since there are so many positive ways to do so. People can create their own brands on social media. People can learn valuable skills and meet new people using technology. Dating is so much easier with these different apps you can use nowadays and it has led to many happier lives all around. This is what our life is now, so we need to not ignore it, but strategize on how to allow it to enhance our lives!\n",
