What seems like a long time ago, if you wanted to play a multiplayer game, you had multiple controllers, food, snacks, drinks, and your friends would come over to your house to play (or you would go to theirs). These friends were not complete strangers. Sure, there was fun loving jibbing each other sometimes, but no one felt like they were really under personal attack.\n\nToday if you play a game online, you stay at home and connect your PC or console to the internet and join an online game. Gamers have become toxic to each other across because there is no longer a sense of personal connectedness or friendship at all. It's easy to call someone a loser when there is no consequences for said action.\n\nThe same thing will take place across screens for work and school as time goes by. People will not feel that sense of comradery at work anymore. Kids won't develop a social sense of friendship with kids outside the home anymore, and teachers won't feel as dedicated to their students or bosses to their employees.\n",
