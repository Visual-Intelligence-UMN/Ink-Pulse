Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, the character of \"Mammy\" in Gone with the Wind makes me not want to watch the movie.  Gone with the Wind was created in a different time period so I understand that things were different then.  However, the character of \"Mammy\" just has too many negative stereotypes regarding African-Americans for me.  It makes the movies unwatchable.  It hurts me to see African-American characters that are portrayed in a way where they don't seem to have the mental faculties to be their own character.   They aren't portrayed as intelligent enough to be independent from the other characters who tend to be non-African-American.  \n",
