I honestly cant think of one disadvantage to audiobooks over regular books other then how relaxing it can be to sit outside and read on a nice day. Then again, I could just listen to the book and enjoy the scenery. \nIn my opinion, without any doubt is that audiobooks are superior to regular books on almost every level.\n",
