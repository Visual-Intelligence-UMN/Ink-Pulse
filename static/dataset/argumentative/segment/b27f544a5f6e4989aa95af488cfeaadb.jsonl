She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, \"Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful.\" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive.

I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, \"Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful.\" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother.

        "text": "Is It Selfish to Pursue Risky Sports Like Extreme Mountain Climbing?\n\nSome sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, \"Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful.\" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.\n\nSo I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.\n\nBut really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling. I feel the same way about extreme mountain climbing. We should not glorify people's desire to put their lives at such extreme risk. And for this reason, we should not call it an actual sport. \n\nIf I were to draw a legal distinction between what I consider dangerous versus what is dangerous enough to constitute a ban on an activity, I would use examples from the United States Code.
