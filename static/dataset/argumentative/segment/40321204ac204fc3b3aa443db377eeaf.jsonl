Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, the Japanese-American internment during WWII is one of the most misused, under-utilized stories for media characters.

These films have instilled a lot of fear in the public , especially toward Japanese people. \n\nThe fact is, without knowing how and why it happened, many people began to despise any Japanese person or culture. There became an associate of Japanese culture with violence and hatred. The reason for this misunderstanding is that cultures are often viewed as bad.

Hopefully there will one day be an end to this. If we foster a positive discussion about the issue then we can understand history, and learn how to not repeat these events. Maybe there will be a shift in the way different cultures are portrayed in films.   It should not be a one-sided story, there should be multiple perspectives of characters of every race and culture. This is a truth that most people do not know, and will hopefully learn about. These stories can change history, instead of repeating the past.\n",
