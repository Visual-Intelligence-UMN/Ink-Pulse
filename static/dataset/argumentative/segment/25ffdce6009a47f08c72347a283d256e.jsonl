Not sure if that is the reason they still aren't readily available or not. It does make me wonder if the boys needed these items, would they be in abundance? I absolutely think these items should be required by school. Giving the girls tokens of some sort if the school wanted to keep a machine in the girls bathrooms and locker rooms would be an idea. Each girl could get a certain number of tokens every month to access the machines and get what she needed. I have been to schools where there were pad and tampon machines in the girl's areas, but they cost a quarter to purchase. Honestly, what student is really carrying around change to buy these?\n\nThis is a basic need that females have to deal with every month. It already sucks enough without having to go and beg for a pad or tampon when you are having a crisis and bleeding in your underwear. There is no valid reason in my mind for the schools not to provide these items.\n",
