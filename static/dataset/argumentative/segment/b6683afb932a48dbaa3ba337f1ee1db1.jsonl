The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.\n\nI could say similar things about Netflix.
