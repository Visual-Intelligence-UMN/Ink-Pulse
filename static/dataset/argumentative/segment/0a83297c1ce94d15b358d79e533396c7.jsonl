        "text": "How Worried Should We Be About Screen Time During the Pandemic?\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.\n\nBut should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, we should be both worried about excessive screen time, but also glad that the pandemic did not hit so early that we would be denied the chance to use our screens in this fashion.  \n\nI am worried about screen time in general, not just during the pandemic, because I believe that it is a major factor in the epidemic of childhood obesity and the rise in childhood diabetes.  This is, of course, also a factor of portion sizes and the increasing amounts of sugar and fat that are included in convenience foods that are marketed toward children.  Given that most families have two working parents, and some of them have more than one job, we cannot pass judgment on families for this outcome.  They simply do not have the time to cook at home or to engage in vigorous exercise with their children.  If screens were not so enticing to children (perhaps, because we lived in an earlier time) or because parents were deliberately denying their children screen time, then it is possible that they would play outside more often.  This additional exercise would be good for their bodies and possibly their minds as well.  \n\nI am also worried about screen time because of the potential for addiction.  Video games and social media are almost tailor-made to feed out brain's desire for feedback and stimulation, and it can be hard to drag ourselves away from devices that give us what we want.  \n\nAlthough these trends are worrying, we have to accept the world as it is, and there is little that we can do to change other people's behavior unless they themselves are willing to change.  This would require a mutual desire in both children and parents to limit their exposure to screens, and this perfect situation is rare.  \n\nMy broader point is that we should be worried about screen time, especially for children.  We should also be worried about the amount of time that we spend on our own screens, and we should try to limit our screen time as much as possible.  Social media and even video games can have the same effect on adult brains as they do on children.  Likewise, a sedentary lifestyle can be unhealthy for anyone, so we need to force ourselves to get up and move, preferably outside.  \n\nWhen it comes to the pandemic, however, I think we have to accept that screens (while dangerous when over-used) are very helpful.  We need to be able to communicate with our families and friends, and we need to be able to access information about the virus.  Internet-connected devices may feed our addictions, but they also allow us to keep in touch with the people we care about.  If kids were playing outside with their friends, they might have spread the virus and caused much more loss of life than we have already seen.  And keeping kids indoors, in isolation, without any way to communicate would probably be worse for their long-term health than excessive socialization on the internet has been.  \n\nAnd so, the bottom line is that we should be worried about screen time, but we should also be glad that the pandemic hit when it did.  Screentime has been a crutch that has helped get us through a very difficult period in our lives and in our history.  However, whenever we are safely able to do so, we should try to return to a life in which interactions are sometimes made in person, and in which people interact in the real world.  It is healthier for us on so many levels to be active, social, and connected.  Once the acute risk of disease has passed, or has at least been controlled, we should try to get ourselves back out there.\n\n\n",
