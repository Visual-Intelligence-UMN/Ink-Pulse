In these cases, they are really only risking their own life and limb, and as long as they are prepared to pay the consequences, they should be allowed to do so.  \n\nHowever, it becomes selfish to the point of being dangerous when such risk forces others, who might not know better or be aware of the risks to pay some of the ultimate cost.  If an extreme athlete is uninsured, or has publicly provided health insurance, he or she is passing on the cost of any potential injury to the broader community.  You could make the case that even a fully-insured athlete is using hospital resources that might be better applied elsewhere, but I feel that this is not really salient.  If one were to take this position, we would have to consider children selfish every time they take a risk, and I am not willing to go that far.  It is the willful refusal (or inability) to pay for the consequences of one's actions that I consider to be selfish, and most extreme athletes do not engage in such conduct.  \n\nHowever, I am not willing to completely dismiss the notion that some sports are too dangerous to be considered sporting events at all.  One on one combat is a genre of sports that definitely comes close to, and sometimes crosses this line.  I would agree that athletes should be allowed to engage in boxing, wrestling, or other martial-arts contests that involve physical contact and serious risk of injury to themselves and to their counterpart, but only if they are fully aware of what they are doing.  Obviously, those under 18 or those who are not otherwise considered mentally-able to sign a contract should be barred from these sports for that reason.  And, of course, if someone chose to engage in combat sports without adequate ability to pay for potential injuries, I would consider that action to be selfish.  They are unduly burdening others in society for the sake of their own excitement.\n\nSo, yes, there are risks when engaging in extreme sports, but it is important to remember that there are risks in most sports and in most aspects of daily life.  I hope that my point has been clear, that others should be free to take these risks with their own bodies, and with the bodies of willing co-participants.  \n\nWhat would be selfish, would be forcing the risk of any kind of harm, including financial harm, on others who do not consent.  \n",
