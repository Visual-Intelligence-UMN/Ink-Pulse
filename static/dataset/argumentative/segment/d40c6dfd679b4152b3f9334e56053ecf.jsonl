Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?\n\n---\n\nYoung men generally take risks. The reasons for this are unclear. Some argue that the human brain is not fully formed until the late twenties. What ever the reason, soldiers who willingly risk death are almost always young men. The same is true for extreme mountain climbers.\n\nIt is a well-known fact that the majority of deaths among professional rock climbers occur in the twenties, the prime of their lives.\n\nIt is generally thought that men crave risk, even foolishly so, while women acknowledge risks much more realistically. Although that may be an oversimplification, there is clearly an underlying difference between the way men and women deal with risk.\n\nGiven these facts, would society condone risk-taking by young males by allowing extreme sports. The fact is, society already condone risk-taking by young males by recruiting them for the armed services. So there is less of a moral issue here than one might at first think.\n\nAll sports have an element of risk, and injuries are common. More than a few men have even died as a result of sports injuries. There is a point, however, where the sheer level of risk involved begins to feel too high. Perhaps those who participate in extreme sports may indeed be pushing that point, but the important fact is that young men will court the same level of risk whether people will pay to watch or not. It is their nature. So we who watch extreme sports do not really alter the equation, we just enjoy what they do.\n\nThe fact is, men can choose for themselves whether they take on risk. And spectators can choose for themselves whether to watch it. There may be moral issues here, but none of them align with the differences between extreme sports and other activities.\n\nWhat Do You Think?\n",
