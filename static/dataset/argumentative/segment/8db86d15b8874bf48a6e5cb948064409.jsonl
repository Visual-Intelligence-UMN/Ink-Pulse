Mainly, I think it's important to have an awareness about what is going on because it gives you a platform for making a difference and taking action. Keeping your head in the sand and not knowing the issues that are going on in the world or in your own community doesn't help anyone and it's sort of dangerous to not have a view of your own.   You need to have an opinion and position on issues, because they are around you and affect everyone. There will come a day when we all need take action. 9/11, for example , ended up being a turning point for the United States. Many people were in the dark leading up to that event, but once it happened, everyone was forced to be aware of what was going on and take action. If something that monumental were to happen today, people wouldn't know where to go and how to voice their opinions if they hadn't been keeping up with current events. The worst thing would be to have no clue how to go about acting because you never really knew the issues in the first place. You'll have to rely on the voices around you in the midst of chaos and confusion.\n",
