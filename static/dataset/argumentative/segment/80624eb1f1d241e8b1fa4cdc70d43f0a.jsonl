That is, they aren't provided as a matter of course. Do schools supply students with enough toilet paper to use at home? No. Do they give students soap to take with them and wash their hands 7 days a week? Heck no! Are students given a supply of Band-Aids to take home and use whenever they cut themselves during the year? Of course not! \n\nAll of these items are provided to students when they are needed on school facilities, but clearly students have access to them at home, too, not provided by the school, but by their parents. Tampons are a little different, in that, unlike soap, which students might use at home, and then need in the school bathroom, a tampon or pad is typically used while in a hygienic spot, the bathroom at home, and then worn until it is removed, and only replaced in public when it's absolutely needed.
