How so?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, technology both improves and worsens dating experiences depending on how you use it. There are pros and cons to everything and dating apps and websites are no different. Many people have had success with dating apps. People meet on the app and fast forward 5-10 years and they're married. \n\nTechnology has helped ease the stress and anxiety that goes into dating. I don't care who you are, there is always nerves when you're meeting someone for the first time that you're attracted to. Luckily, technology allows us to break the ice and speak to those people before meeting them in person. FaceTime allows us to confirm that the person we're talking to on the other side is real and isn't a Catfish as well.\n\nSpeaking of Catfish, that is definitely a negative aspect of dating technology. There even was a television show made about it. Catfishing is simply using someone else's profile picture on a dating app to trick them into thinking they're talking to someone that they're not actually talking to. Catfishing has been used for revenge as well as in scenarios where the catfishers just have very low self esteem.\n\nAnother positive aspect of technology that probably doesn't get talked about enough is the ability to catch someone cheating with evidence. This evidence can be via photograph, video or text messages. Now you might be thinking this is a negative aspect but to me, it's a positive.\n\nIf you were being cheated on, would you want to know or would you rather never know and your partner is screwing you over on a daily basis and being with someone else. Sure the pain in the beginning hurts really bad but that pain is only temporary. That pain isn't as bad as being married to someone that is a cheater and doesn't truly love you.\n\nSo in general, dating apps and websites and other technology have both a positive and negative affect on relationships. Since I am an optimist, I would say that the good outweighs the bad. \n\n",
