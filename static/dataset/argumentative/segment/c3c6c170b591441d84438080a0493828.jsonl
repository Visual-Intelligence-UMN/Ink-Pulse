That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on? Maybe at some point it will just be a place for athletes to go to make money and be recruited. Sometimes following the money isn't the right thing. This is one of those cases. \n\nAthletes already have every advantage given to them. Lets choose not to ruin the foundations of college just to give them even more power. We have to think of everyone, especially the often forgotten artists of this world. \n",
