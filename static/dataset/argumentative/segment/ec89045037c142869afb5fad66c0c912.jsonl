Why then do they alone have to pay to manage this?  Every month the product of a woman's choice should be sent to her home free of charge.  It should be regarded as a well deserved thank you for what women do, which only they can do, continue the human race.  \n\nI can guarantee if men had periods this would have been done and we wouldn't be having this discussion today.  It's a sexist world.  I wonder if other countries handle this differently?  We should explore that except it is a taboo subject in the USA.\n",
