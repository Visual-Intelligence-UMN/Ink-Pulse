That's what makes it worth watching. So I can not say I would not ever watch a show full of stereo typical type characters, because sometimes people take it to personally when it's not meant to be. It's just a show. Enjoy it, and forget your worries and laugh a little bit. I feel we have almost forgotten how to do that.\n",
