        "text": "Are We Being Bad Citizens If We Don't Keep Up With the News?\n\nIn your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, someone who does not keep up with the news is not a bad citizen, but they cannot call themselves a good and responsible citizen either.  In other words, I think that everyone has some responsibility to know what is going on in the world, but I do not think that it is a requirement to call oneself a citizen.\n\nThe news ultimately affects all of us, whether directly, or indirectly through the political process.  We cannot make good decisions without being informed, so I think that it is important for any responsible citizen to follow events in the news and to understand the historical underpinnings of events.  \n\nIf one does not follow the news in the world, and does not therefore understand what is happening, they will be apt to make bad decisions that not only affect themselves, but could potentially be harmful for others as well.  Think of the people who refuse to listen to scientific fact about vaccines.  They are the reason why Covid-19 has not been controlled in the United States, despite the fact that we have ample access to vaccines.  This lack of information, or more seriously, abundance of false information, has been literally deadly to many.\n\nHowever, I do not think that it is necessary for everyone to be a news junkie.  I think that it is important to be informed, but I do not think that it is necessary to know every detail of every story.  In fact, spending too much time concentrating on current events can actually be harmful in itself, since it would distract from other pursuits.  Getting too bogged down in the minutiae of up-to-the-minute events can also lead to a poor understanding of the events themselves, since one will not be able to step back and see the history.  One would not be seeing the forest because the trees are in the way, as the old saying goes.\n\nMy opinion of the news media is not strictly positive, though.  Media outlets, at best, chase ratings or (in the case of public broadcasting) donations from members, and this can lead them to focus on eye-catching reporting at the expense of important reporting.  Very few news outlets spend much time on budgetary concerns in government, or distant ethnic tensions, because readers are not interested, but if this information was pushed to the forefront, it could be beneficial to everyone.  \n\nIn addition, we cannot pretend that the news media is impartial and unbiased.  All persons are biased toward a certain viewpoint, and this bias can become entrenched when journalists have to please college professors and later editors who all tend to feel the same way.  When alternative media outlets pop up, they end up pushing brainless conspiracy theories instead of giving fact-based rebuttals to biases at other sources, because this is what their viewers want to hear.  And even when they act responsibly, highly partisan news sources often take an extreme position, even when they back it up with facts and evidence.  \n\n\n\nIn conclusion, I think that everyone has some responsibility to be informed about the world around them, but I do not think that it is necessary\n",

Finally, responsible citizens need to not only follow the news, but also try to get a deeper understanding of what led to current events.  Some of the time spent reading the newspapers would be better spent reading a book that chronicles the full story of a recent, or current, event.  \n",
