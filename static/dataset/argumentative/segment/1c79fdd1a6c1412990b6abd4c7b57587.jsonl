Humans are social animals and they need social skills to survive in the society, no matter what profession they are in. So I do not support homeschooling. I do not want to sound mean, but I have seen too much abuse to kids by parents who think they can teach better than the schools. A parent cannot replace a teacher. Also, at home, you lack the setting to imitate the actual society which contains different kinds of people. Therefore, your child might end up not being okay with others. So, I do not think homeschooling is effective because it destroys your so-called social life. \n\nAt school, teachers act like your guardians and the classmates act like someone that you interact with everyday. Students learn to obey authority and the rules set by the school. They interact with their peers while following the school rules, just like adults following the rules set by their workplace. The school will allow your child to experience what it’s like to follow rules everyday, like how it should be done in the real world. This will make them better prepared for their future life.\n\nAs a conclusion, the most important things students should learn in school is how to interact and get along with their peers. \n",
