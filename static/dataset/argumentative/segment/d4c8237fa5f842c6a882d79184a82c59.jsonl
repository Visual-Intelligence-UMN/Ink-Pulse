I think that all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world, as engaging with current events actually does something. It helps us be more aware of what is going on in the world and how we can help, so we are bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news  and just care about our own things. For example, if there are some people in need of help in our society due to some tragic events, we can be informed with news and act accordingly to help those needy  people. If we don't read news, we shall become ignorant and miss the chance of helping needy people. Besides, sometimes there are government news and rules that we should be aware of. Only by keeping up with the news can we get those information and act appropriately.  If everyone keep up with the news, the society would be more cohesive and the world would advance better. To conclude, I think that we are bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. \n",
