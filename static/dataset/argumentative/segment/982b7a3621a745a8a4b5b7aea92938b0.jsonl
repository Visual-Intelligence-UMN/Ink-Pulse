        "text": "What Stereotypical Characters Make You Cringe?\n\nWhat stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, stereotypes that are portrayed in works of fiction are generally not intended to be harmful, and may come about unconsciously, but they do exacerbate feelings that lead to discrimination against, and sometimes direct harm to, marginalized groups in society.  For this reason, I would generally prefer not to watch or read something that revels in stereotypes, but sometimes I endure such things because of the cultural or entertainment value.  I suspect that if I was a member of a marginalized group, or was otherwise directly affected, I might take a stronger stance against such works. \n\nI have already written at length about how I feel about stereotypes in general, so for today, I would like to talk about some of the most egregious instances of stereotyping in my reading or viewing experiences.  \n\nPlease note that in all cases, I am not claiming negligence on the part of the author.  I cannot know or predict what the author truly had in mind, but I will allow for the possibility (nay, the probability) that the author was simply relaying feelings that he or she had picked up from society.  The fact that society felt this way is not the author's fault, but I still take exception to the fact that the author reinforces these feelings.\n\nSo, onto the business at hand, the most common and harmful stereotype I see is that of black people.  This goes back to the Jim Crow era in which African-Americans were portrayed as happy fools who loved to work on plantations, where they could dance and sing in the sunlight.  Needless to say, this was never true, but it made white audiences feel better about themselves.  In this one case, I think that the stereotype was indeed created from willful malice.  \n\nHattie McDaniels's character in Gone with the Wind is another example.  She is portrayed as someone who would be helpless if she was not enslaved by a rich white family, and we are meant to believe that she is grateful for what she received.  However, this is also an instance in which a black woman was humanized and portrayed fairly respectfully on screen, so I cannot totally object to it.  \n\nFor a far more serious example, let us consider the trope of the \"black friend.\"  This is often a character who is portrayed with no depth, and simply exists to make the main characters (who are almost always white) appear to be more tolerant and worldly.

This is just as bad as explicitly claiming that all black people are involved in crime, because that is what the audience is led to believe.  \n\nThe only possible situation in which I would tolerate a stereotype is if it were portrayed by an obviously ignorant character, in a fictional setting, who could not be expected to know any better.  This might actually be beneficial for society, because audiences who came to see a heroic white cast, might end up learning a subtle lesson about questioning the stereotypes that pervade our society.  \n\nUnfortunately, I cannot readily think of an example in which I have seen this happen in fiction, and there have been far to many examples of harmful stereotypes.  I hope that the few examples which I had time to share were illustrative of the broader point.\n",
