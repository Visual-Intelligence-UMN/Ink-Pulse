        "text": "How Worried Should We Be About Screen Time During the Pandemic?\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.\n\nBut should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. \n\nI think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens as much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? \n\nMoreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show \n",
