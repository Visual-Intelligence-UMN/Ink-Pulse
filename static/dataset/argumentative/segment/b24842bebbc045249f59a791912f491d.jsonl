Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.\n\nOf course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.\n\nThis isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. Many of today's stories, though they bend over backwards to be 'politically correct' and 'non-problematic' have stereotypes.  The 'bad father', the 'overworked single mother', the 'depressed woman with a cat', the 'female character who is more capable, smarter, and morally virtuous than any of the male characters' are all examples of modern stereotypes that are acceptable now, but will one day doubtless be viewed as offensive, dated, and in bad taste, to the same extent Uncle Remus is now.\n\nSo I personally, accept stereotypes in fiction, and would never turn down or run from a book or a film because of its presence. I try to see beyond the stereotype. to the universal story that the writer is \n",
