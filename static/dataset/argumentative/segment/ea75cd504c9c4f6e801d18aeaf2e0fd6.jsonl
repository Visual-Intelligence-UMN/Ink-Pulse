What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.\n\nUsing time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.\n\nOnce again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.\n\nI had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.\n\nI think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.\n\nThink about where we would be without understanding the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with each other. Think about where we would be as a species if we didn't know how to do anything math related. We wouldn't even know if we were getting ripped off at the supermarket when we were given change. \n\nIn general, school is different for everyone and as people we also value different things that we learn. For me personally, self discipline and using my time efficiently was the most important thing because they translated into success for my adult life. I understand however that that will be different for everyone. I just hope all students really take something from their school days and it leads to success in their adult life. \n",
