I prefer that if people are going to create content, they should at least try to be more creative and thoughtful in how they portray characters, given how much that can help in lessening the prevalence of stereotypes in society, and help in the process of making others feel accepted for who they are. There are plenty of content available for people to watch, read, or hear, that can be entertaining and informative. Many of these shows are not offensive in its depiction of its characters, and don't necessarly rely on stereotypes. I think many shows, books, and other forms of content will continue to improve in how it depicts its characters, with more content like it becoming more numerous and widespread. Thus I think it is important for myself and others to support such content, and to not watch or even critique content that portray people as negative stereotypes.\n",
