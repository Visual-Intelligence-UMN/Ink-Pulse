It's a social learning experience just as much as it is about actual learning. \n\nPeople will take different things away from the experience. Some will learn how to work with others and how to be a team player. Others will learn that they prefer to keep to themselves in life. Some will learn how to be a leader and others will learn how to follow. These things will help to guide you in life. You'll figure out the type of job that may work for you. You'll also figure out who you want to associate with. \n\nI have learned a lot in school. For me it was just learning about myself primarily, but that was important. I learned that I like to take a different path than most. I like to do things my own way. That's what makes me happy. I'm not someone who wants to be defined by a specific title or job. People can't always understand that, but I'm okay with that.\n\nSo I think the most important thing to learn in school overall is about who you are. It's about learning how to be yourself and not worry about what others think. It helps to shape you into your own unique person. \n",
