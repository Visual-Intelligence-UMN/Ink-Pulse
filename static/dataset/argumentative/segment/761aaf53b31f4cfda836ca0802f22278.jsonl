It was something we were all aware of, realized it was probably not right but still perpetuated it out of habit. I think it is a subconscious thing that we are not aware of when making friends, it just kind of happened. These black friends were more then token black friends to us though. They were full human beings like the rest of us. I look back and wish we included more minorities in our groups. We would have all been better for it. Unfortunately blacks are still second rate citizens and these sterotypes do not help in any way. We need to give minorities more prominent roles in entertainment. If we do that it will eventually spill over into the real world. \n",
