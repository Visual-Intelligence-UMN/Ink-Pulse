For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. \n",
