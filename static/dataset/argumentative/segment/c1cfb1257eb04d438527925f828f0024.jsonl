I know that believing in myself and others will help in my career and or other opportunities I experience in my life. Trust is critical in group situations, which I face a good portion at work. Without trust, cohesion is affected and you are forced to work individually when many tasks require the work efforts and skill set of others. For those reasons and more, I believe students benefit from a school experience as it helps them work well with others, to build self-confidence and their self-esteem along with the ability to confine in colleagues, friends, and other people they will encounter in life. \n",
