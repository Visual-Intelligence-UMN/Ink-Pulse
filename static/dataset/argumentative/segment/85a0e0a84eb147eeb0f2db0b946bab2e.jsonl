Its a stereotype I would like to see disappear because we are all dumb when it comes to most things in life. Nobody should be singling out any hair color when we are all severely ill informed on most things. What may be perceived as a harmless stereotype actually ruins lives or at least partially  and we need to recognize that in order to fix it. \n",
