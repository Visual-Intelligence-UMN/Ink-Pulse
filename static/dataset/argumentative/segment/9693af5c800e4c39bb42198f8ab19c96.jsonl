You don't hear about \"towel poverty\". It is not an issue. I am not a female and I do not have first-hand experience with this, but I never heard any of the girls in my school get teased for anything like \"period poverty\". I think that schools would be actually helping the female students out by making pads available to them. I don't think they should be shamed for not having a sanitary napkin on them at all times or have that be a reason to not make tampons or pads available to students. Maybe having some sort of pamphlet or lesson on how to not make your classmates feel bad about their bodily functions may help alleviate any issues with how students are treated regarding their periods. I do not see any reason to not be able to offer pads and tampons to students as it stands.\n",
