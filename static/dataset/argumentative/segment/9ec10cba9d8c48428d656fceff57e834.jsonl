They provide a a much more immersive experience than audiobooks. There's something about the act of reading a book, consciously, that can makes you feel like you're in the story, and that's something that audiobooks can't provide.

There are no limitations of the environment or pacing or the author's voice, and everything is created by the reader's imagination. Books can also be read at one's own pace, which is impossible with audiobooks. It can be very frustrating to be eagerly awaiting the next event in a book, and then have to wait for the narrator to finish a sentence, a paragraph, or a chapter. \n\nIn closing, audiobooks aren't a replacement for books, and they aren't really better or worse.
