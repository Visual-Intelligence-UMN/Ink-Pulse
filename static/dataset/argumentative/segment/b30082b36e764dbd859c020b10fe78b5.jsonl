        "text": "How Do You Think Technology Affects Dating?\n\nHave you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?\n\nHow do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, technology (specifically dating apps and social media) has allowed people to find love in a shorter period of time than before. Before, people had to go to events, parties or the typical 'networking' sites in order to find a mate. But nowadays, people can swipe/text/click their way to love in the comfort of their own homes.\n\nI have used dating apps in the past, to varying degrees of success. I've been able to match with a lot of people before, and even had some worthwhile conversations with several! However in the end, I never ended up finding the \"right\" person for me through an app.\n\nThat's okay, though! Because even if I had met all those same people in-person, we still wouldn't have worked out. Moreover, it would have taken me much longer to find that out. And wouldn't it be a shame to spend months or even years of one's life with the wrong person, only to realize they aren't the \"one?\" \n\nTechnology has reduced the time spent of finding the \"one,\" because apps/websites/social media allow you to talk with multiple people simultaneously in a convenient, informal manner. You can be the person you're most comfortable being, both in real life and online, for example hanging around in your pajamas while using slang with your virtual date. Because we're all so familiar with technology and the internet is seen as a casual space, it's easier for us to be ourselves when there's a screen in front of us; contrast this with going out to a fancy restaurant with a stranger and having to awkwardly pretend to be more polite than you really are.\n\nThe effect is that chatting through an app is like a speedrun for getting to know somebody. You can get a lot of information in a small time and you can figure out much more easily whether or not a relationship is worth pursuing. It's lower stress, it's more comfortable, it's more convenient, it's more expensive, and it's a way to keep from \"wasting\" your life on dates that won't go anywhere.\n\nSo all-in-all, technology is a good thing for dating. Dating apps help us to connect with people, they allow us to build relationships faster, they allow us to be more honest with our dates, and they allow us to find the right person much more easily than before.\n",
