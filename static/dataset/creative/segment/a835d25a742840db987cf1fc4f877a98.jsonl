The people of the US are angry. They want to know why the other nations didn't honor their agreement. In a prepared statement, the president of the rest of the Earth told them it was because they were not ready to move forward with the rest of the world. \n\nThe president of the United States, in response, declares war on the rest of the world. The president sends troops to every other country, but quickly loses communication with the commanders of those forces. The president then orders a nuclear strike on the rest of the world, but the missiles are intercepted by the rest of the world's forces. The president is frustrated that the US has not been able to kill anyone over this outrage. \n\nLater that same day, the president receives an email from the commander of all of the forces he had sent around the world. The letter details how much better things are, now that the world is at peace. All of the soldiers who were sent to fight the rest of the world have joined the enemy. They didn't want to fight anymore, once they saw how happy everyone else in the world was. The letter ends with the commander asking the president to join them.\n\nThe president makes the trip, because there is no more army to protect the US border anyway. The president is welcomed with open arms by the people of the rest of the world. They insist on hugging the president, when he arrives at the world capital. The president doesn't like it, but accepts it as a foreign custom. The president is then taken to a banquet, where he is served the best food he has ever had.\n\nThe president of the world is there too, but it turns out that her job is mainly to make sure that everyone is happy. The president of the United States is confused. He doesn't know what to do. He is not used to being happy. He can't help but to feel happy about this development though. It's all just, very nice. The president of the world tells the president of the United States that he can stay as long as he likes. The president of the United States gives his last order to the people of the US. \n",
