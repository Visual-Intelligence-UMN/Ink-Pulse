By this time the smoke was so thick around the house that the wolf could not see two feet in front of him. As he tried to make its way to fresh air, the wolf finally collapsed due to the fact that it was breathing in irradiated fumes that eventually liquefied the wolfs and the pigs insides, effective killing them both.\n",
