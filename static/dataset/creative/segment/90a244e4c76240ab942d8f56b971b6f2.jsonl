        "text": "When you die, you appear in a cinema with a number of other people who look like you. You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. You can't resist looking around the theater, at your doubles, though. The more you stare at any individual, the more they change into all that was different from you in their life, by comparison, and you can't help but notice that while watching their life, you feel like they are completely different from you. Once you look away, though, it seems you forget the differences, unwillingly and unwittingly, and they come to resemble you once again, as identical as you could imagine. \n\n\"What if this is just a dream?\" You suppose it would only matter so much, as waking up could be a new life, a continuation, not that you'd know the difference. You look at the big screen. There, you can see your new life unfold, before it's even begun. The more you stare, the more you become attached to it, and the harder it is to look away! You're sure that if you watch too long you'll lose yourself completely. Maybe this is a way to control your fate, you wonder... Thinking on this you realize that you could never command control forever; eventually you'd lose focus, fall asleep, get hit by a bus... you could never have control forever, but you could have it for a moment. That thought pleases you, so long as a moment doesn't extend into a future that you feel compelled to control. The movie ends, and you look at the blank screen. The movie picks up exactly where you watched it last, no change despite hearing it in the background! Now you're sure that you must succumb to the story. \n\n\"No story makes a person who they are,\" the voice in your head says. \"That's wishful thinking!\" you blurt out loud. You get up and leave the theater. It's dark outside. Suddenly, the screen is back, filling your entire sight! You give in, accepting this new path thrown before you, and you enter the theater again, never to leave.\n",
