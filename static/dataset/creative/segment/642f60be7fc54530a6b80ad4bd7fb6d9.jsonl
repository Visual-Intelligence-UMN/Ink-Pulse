Everyone is upset. It's all over the news. The government is involved. People are storming the Capital in protest. There is panic in the streets. People want justice restored. The people want every dad to be #1. \n\nThe CEO of the mug company stands his ground. A reporter asks him why he can't just change the mugs back to where they were. \"I can't keep living a lie. Not every dad is #1. In fact, there can only be one number one. The only way to know who that really is, is to rate every dad. So that's what I did. I'm just being honest.\" \n\nThe reporter then asks him what he is going to do about the people protesting outside. \"I would suggest meditation and deep breathing. That should help them resolve their feelings about the kind of parents they are.\" \n\nThe CEO then says, \"I think I'm going to go home and visit my dad.\" The reporter asks, \"And where does your dad rank on the list of dads?\"\n\n\"Oh, he's 7,345. We have some issues to work out. But don't worry, he still gets a mug.\" The reporter shook her head. \"I noticed you have a mug there yourself.\" \n\n\"Yes, I am #3,982.\"\n\n\"But you don't have any children. So why do you have a dad mug at all?\" \n\n\"I will be someday. And I don't have high expectations for myself, let's be real.\" The story aired on the news that night. The CEO of the mug company was available for comments. His first comment was to announce that next year, the Honest Mug company would be offering ranked mugs for Mother's Day. The reporter looked into the camera and said, \"The number one mother is available to comment on that story.\n",
