You have been able to review your life in full from a third parties perspective to get the full picture of your days as a human being. Humans were the first technological species in the universe and their development over the eons has helped guide all other civilizations after. As part of the new galactic educational system, living beings that have reached technological maturity all participate in many simulations in order to learn. This is the first and most important one of all. It was the first time evolution created a being able to recreate the universe as it sees fit. \n",
