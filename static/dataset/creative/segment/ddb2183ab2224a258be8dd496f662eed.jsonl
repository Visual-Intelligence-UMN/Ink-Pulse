So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.\n\nThe 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, \"dude.\" The pig said \"what do you want?\" The wolf yelled at the pig and said it was unfair that the pig built a house out of a material that can't be blown down.\n\nThe pig responded and told the wolf to leave him and his friends alone and find some new animals to pick on. The pig decided to spread the word to the rest of his friends. As the days went on, each pigs began to build their homes using depleted uranium. The wolf was very distressed and felt that he had lost his purpose in life. He had spent years blowing down little pigs homes. \n\nThe wolf came back to the neighborhood and saw that all the homes were now made of depleted uranium so he started to do research on the internet. He had to figure out what he could do to blow depleted uranium down. Unfortunately, there was nothing he could do to blow the home down. However he did find that he could destroy the homes by shooting fireworks at them.\n\nHe found that interesting but depleted uranium has a chemical reaction with fireworks that causes the depleted uranium to disintegrate.\n\nThe wolf went to the store and bought a bunch of fireworks. He decided to drive over to the neighborhood and go through with his plan. He had all of the fireworks in the bed of his truck. He lit the fireworks and shot them at the pigs homes but to his surprise the fireworks just bounced off of the homes and nothing happened.\n\nThe wolf was shocked and didn't understand what was happening. The pigs came out of their homes and told the wolf they had to tell him a secret. They went up to the wolf and told him that the homes weren't made of depleted uranium. They tricked the wolf and have found a material that cannot be destroyed no matter what the wolf does. \n\nThe pigs celebrated together knowing that they have finally beaten the wolf at his own game. \n",
