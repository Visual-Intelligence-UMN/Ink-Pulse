I will build only the finest houses for my fellow countrymen.\"\n\nThe wolf was like, \"dude, I'm a wolf. like, have you ever heard the phrase 'lone wolf'?\"\n\nThe 92nd little pig said, \"no, I have not heard that phrase. But I don't like the sound of it one bit. I think that you may not be trustworthy.\"\n\nThe wolf answered, \"Maybe not. But at least I'm not a total jerk.\" He walked away, thinking that maybe it was a little mean of him to not tell the pig how dangerous the Uranium was. But that little pig was such a jerk! \n\nThe 92nd little pig was a very patriotic pig. So patriotic that he decided he needed to do something about the wolf. He went to the local police station and said, \"I want to report a wolf.\" \"And I want to report that his is a danger to the country.\"\n\nThe police took that kind of thing very seriously. So they sent the 92nd little pig to the FBI. And there the little pig told them all about what the wolf said about the Russian. And he may have added a few other details in, to embellish the story a little and make sure the FBI understood just how dangerous the wolf was.\n\nThe FBI took that kind of thing very seriously. The headed out to the wolf's house. In the meantime, the wolf had decided that it was mean not to warn the little pig about the Uranium, and decided to go tell him right away. \n\nWhen the wolf got to the little pig's house, the FBI was already there. The arrested the wolf immediately. \"But, he said, I need to tell you something important! I was just going to tell the little pig that he shouldn't build his house out of depleted uranium!\"\n\n\"Shut up\" said the FBI agent. None of us, and certainly not this hero of a little pig, are going to listen to anything you say! And the put the wolf in jail straight away.\n\nThe 92nd little pig was very pleased with himself. Word got out about what a good pig he was, how smart, and how brave. And the townspeople were very proud of him. WHen people came to the pig to hear his story, he always told them about his wonderful Uranium house. Everyone agreed it was wonderful. They all wanted houses just like it, so that they could be like their hero. \n\nSo the little pig started a company that built Uranium houses. And he was very successful. He was very happy. But eventually people started getting sick, and no one knew why. It got worse and worse. Then the FBI agent remembered something the wolf said. He went to the wolf in jail and said, \"I think you were right. Everyone is getting sick. What should we do?\"\n\nThe wolf said \"Knock all of the houses down right away!\" So they let the wolf out of jail, since he was good with houses, and everyone worked together. Once all of the houses were gone, everyone got better.  The wolf became the new hero and from then on, \n",
