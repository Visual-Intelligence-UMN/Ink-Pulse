He tells you that he needs your help to do something tremendously important, and that it's up to you to stop a major threat. You are very concerned and ask what the issue is. He says he is trying to negotiate a cross-border peace treaty with Bermuda and that he needs your help. You immediately jump in to offer your help. It's not everyday that JFK will ask you to help with diplomatic relations! With your help, JFK is able to successfully resolve the matter. \n",
