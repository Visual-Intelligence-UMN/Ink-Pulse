Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the \"Lost Generations\" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.\n\nI was 28 when English scientists discovered a miracle drug that stopped humanity from aging. Humanity had finally discovered the key to living forever, and avoiding the one debt that every human being owes upon birth, death. Scientists had warned that the drug was only meant for citizens under 26, which left billions of people, including myself, without any hope of taking the drug. People around the world were furious and saddened to hear the news that they would not live forever. Meanwhile, the younger generations were divided on whether or not they wanted to live forever. Taking the drug meant living forever or outliving loved ones and watching them pass on. The rest of the world was not as hesitant to take the drug, and many saw immortality as a chance for humanity to expand and achieve incredible things. Taking the drug would allow people to study whatever they wanted and help to improve society for the better. No longer did people have to settle for boring desk jobs, they could pursue any field of study they wanted. Doctors no longer had to worry about sicknesses and disease among a large portion of society, they could now devote their time towards helping people who could not take the drug. The \"Lost Generation\" continued to age, while the young took the drug and became immortal. Families were torn apart, knowing that they would leave loved ones behind. They feared that their loved ones would forget about them as the centuries carried on. While the young celebrated their immortality, the old feared that they would be forgotten. As time passed, I grew older, finally reaching the ripe, old age of 85. Society had definitely improved through the efforts of an immortal, optimistic generation of people, with all the time in the world on their shoulders. They had set their sights on new frontiers that would be impossible for a normal human lifetime. Technology had improved by leaps and bounds, providing comfort beyond imagination for people from all walks of life. Medicinal advances provided the \"Lost Generation\" with cures for ailments that only affected an aging body. I began to wonder if taking the drug was worth it. At a certain point in time, the \"Lost Generation\" would be no more, ceasing to exist, leaving the immortals behind. Was living forever worth it? Were all of the human advances worth it in the end? The immortals were only prolonging the inevitable. I was concerned with how the immortals would feel after living for hundreds of years, or even thousands. Finally, in a shocking turn of events, scientists discovered that the drug resulted in tragic side effects. The immortals began to lose their sight, hearing, taste, sense of smell, all aspects of human life. No longer could they enjoy what made life so pleasurable, the biological features that made life worth living.  \n",

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the \"Lost Generations\" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.\n\nI was 28 when English scientists discovered a miracle drug that stopped humanity from aging. Humanity had finally discovered the key to living forever, and avoiding the one debt that every human being owes upon birth, death. Scientists had warned that the drug was only meant for citizens under 26, which left billions of people, including myself, without any hope of taking the drug. People around the world were furious and saddened to hear the news that they would not live forever. Meanwhile, the younger generations were divided on whether or not they wanted to live forever. Taking the drug meant living forever or outliving loved ones and watching them pass on. The rest of the world was not as hesitant to take the drug, and many saw immortality as a chance for humanity to expand and achieve incredible things. Taking the drug would allow people to study whatever they wanted and help to improve society for the better. No longer did people have to settle for boring desk jobs, they could pursue any field of study they wanted. Doctors no longer had to worry about sicknesses and disease among a large portion of society, they could now devote their time towards helping people who could not take the drug. The \"Lost Generation\" continued to age, while the young took the drug and became immortal. Families were torn apart, knowing that they would leave loved ones behind. They feared that their loved ones would forget about them as the centuries carried on. While the young celebrated their immortality, the old feared that they would be forgotten. As time passed, I grew older, finally reaching the ripe, old age of 85. Society had definitely improved through the efforts of an immortal, optimistic generation of people, with all the time in the world on their shoulders. They had set their sights on new frontiers that would be impossible for a normal human lifetime. Technology had improved by leaps and bounds, providing comfort beyond imagination for people from all walks of life. Medicinal advances provided the \"Lost Generation\" with cures for ailments that only affected an aging body. I began to wonder if taking the drug was worth it. At a certain point in time, the \"Lost Generation\" would be no more, ceasing to exist, leaving the immortals behind. Was living forever worth it? Were all of the human advances worth it in the end? The immortals were only prolonging the inevitable. I was concerned with how the immortals would feel after living for hundreds of years, or even thousands. Finally, in a shocking turn of events, scientists discovered that the drug resulted in tragic side effects. The immortals began to lose their sight, hearing, taste, sense of smell, all aspects of human life.
