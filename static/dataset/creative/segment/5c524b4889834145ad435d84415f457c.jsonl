Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations\" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. Can you survive the world's most dangerous and practical scientific experiment? In the wake of the millions who've already died, you must fight your way through a wasteland full of radioactive mutants, murderous gangs, and animals eating each other including humans and babies.

How You'll Survive: You're all alone in a hostile wasteland with no weapons, just your wits. There is no way i could survive with just the basics like water and food because once the mutants find me and know where i'm hiding i'm just going to be another piece of meat for them. I'd probably have to find a way to make weapons and get ammo for myself and i don't know if i would be able to do that, as things are already scarce. The only way i could survive is if i had a team with me to hunt and protect me while i try to find medicine or a cure.
