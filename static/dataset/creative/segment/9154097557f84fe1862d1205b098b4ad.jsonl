        "text": "Lana has been dating ever since she graduated high school, but it never works out in the end for her. The guys she dates seem interesting and are fun to be around, however there always seems to be some distance between them despite her attempts to get closer to her dates. The truth of the matter is that she is unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over since high school, that is she has been the crush of a shapeshifter for the past couple of years.\n\nAfter she breaks up with the latest guy she's been dating, she finds herself attracted to her new neighbor, Alex. Alex had recently moved in from New York, and had done so after his company has moved to her state. He works in marketing, as a visual designer. They seem to share common interests, but Lana is less interested in that given that the past men she has date all shared her interests as well. One day, Alex asks if he can take Lana out to dinner. Lana accepts, seeing it as an opportunity for her to get close to Alex and learn more about him. \n\nGoing on a date with Alex to a new restaurant, Lana finds the experience interesting, yet at the same time, strangely familiar. Alex seems to hit it well with her, being into the things she likes, such as shows, movies, and even food. However, whenever she presses him on certain questions, she finds that he seems to change the subject, or come up with a reason why he can't talk about it. She doesn't hear about him about many topics about his past, such as where he went to school, his family, or even what he was like as a child. Alex always seems to prefer talking about Lana and his current interests than divulging information about his past. It doesn't come too much as a suprise to Lana, as it seems that is a recurring theme for her past dates and boyfriends, and she tries to enjoy the rest of the evening. They eventually head on back, with Alex wishing her well as he heads back into his apartment. \n\nAs she goes back into the apartment, she ponders whether to continue dating Alex or not. She then hears strange noises, and learns it is coming from Alex's apartment. Worried, she heads out and knocks on his door, noticing it is unlocked. She heads inside, and discovers that bitter truth about Alex. Seeing him changing into someone else, Lana confronts Alex about what she saw. Alex reveals that he is a shapeshifter, and that he has been dating her for the past couple of years. Lana is confused and shocked, which later turns to a strong sense of betrayal as Alex has deceived her all these past years. \n",
