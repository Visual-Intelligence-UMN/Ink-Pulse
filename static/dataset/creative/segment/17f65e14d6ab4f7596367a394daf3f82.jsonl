        "text": "Humans once wielded formidable magical power. But with over 7 billion of us on the planet now, Mana has spread far too thinly to have any effect. When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again.\n\n\n\nThose who can tap into it are known as Drakon.  Drakon are the only ones who can stand against the alien invaders.   But the Drakon have their own secrets and agendas. They are not the only ones with their eyes on this new power.  Many of the Drakon are corrupt, heady with their newfound power. Their thirst to possess Earth's new magic threatens to reignite a war that could not only destroy humanity, but the Drakon themselves.\n\nThe Drakon have begun to abduct humans, experimenting on them with genetic manipulation.   They have also begun to implant the Drakon symbiotic control device known as a soulstone into humans. With this implantation, the Drakon are able to control these humans and use them as spies in order to control mankind.  Many Drakon, however, are benevolent and try to aid humans. But both the good and the evil Drakon are hunted by their enemies, and must remain hidden in human society. \n\n\nThe good Drakon are known as the Guardians, and the evil Drakon are known as Rogues.  They use their mana to heal and restore the human and the world.  It is into this precarious balance that you have been born-a child of a Guardian and a human.  You have been raised among humans, but you possess a power that both the Rogues and Guardians will do anything to control-the ability to wield. mana in its purest form.  \n\nThe uncertainty, chaos, and many rival political parties make the future unclear, even to the most talented of Drakon seers. What will you decide to do? What path will you choose for your destiny? How will you make your own choices in a world filled with war, and where a single misstep can cost you everything?   \n",
