To be honest, he was beginning to be okay with the fact that he would die someday - it wasn't the bitter disappointment is was almost 60 years ago. \n\nBut then the morning was \"as usual\" anymore. \n\nDan was watching the news when the anchorwoman, a young woman who had been with the station for about a year, suddenly froze. She looked about 22, the age most people got the drug, though some got it as early as 16. She was frozen in place, her eyes wide and her mouth slightly open. Staring at the paper and then the teleprompter in front of her. She finally spoke, voice shaky, \"I'm sorry, we have breaking news.\" Last month the earliest recipients of the drug 4EvR all reported to medical centers complaining of headaches. Within 6 hours they had lost their vision and hearing. Within 24 hours they seemed to be comatose, though brain scans showed the same activity levels as a normal, conscious person. They remain in that state.\"\n\nDan stared at the screen in shock. The newscaster continued. \"Scientists have been studying their condition and have come to the conclusion that it is due to the drug 4EvR.\" She began to cry, \"And according to their findings it is not only an inevitable side effect, but also one that is triggered or transmitted to users. To summarize, all people who have ever taken 4EvR will almost certainly have been exposed to others who have been exposed to the original group and we should all expect to experience the same side effects within 2 weeks at the most.\" \n\nDan turned off the TV. He was in shock. He had never taken the drug missing the age cut off by a mere two years, but all of his younger relatives had. His children, his grandchildren, so many others. Ans soon they would essentially be helpless with only a few aged people like himself to take care of them. \n",
