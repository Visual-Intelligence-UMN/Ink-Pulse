As you talk to the bee it reveals the amazing story about the true nature of bees. You learn that bees are really alien lifeforms that came to earth and adopted the form of bees in order to help plants thrive on this planet. You also came from that alien planet as a baby and are in fact the queen of the bee race. Now it is time to take your place and lead the bees in their work to spread life across the universe. \n",
