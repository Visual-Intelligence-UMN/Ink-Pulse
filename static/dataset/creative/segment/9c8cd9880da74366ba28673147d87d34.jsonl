So we all stood in this dark cave for nearly an hour and then slowly, one by one, we all began to glow in the dark, illuminating the cave. The glow grew stronger and brighter. There were bats in the cave and they all flew away from the bright light that we were producing. At that moment, we felt like we were glowing with the power of the Mana once again. When we stepped out of the cave, we were all glowing and continuing to glow brighter and stronger. \n\nThe next day one by one, it was like we all remembered our instincts. This glowing WAS the Mana! and we knew we were invincible to harm with it. We were able to harness this from then on to protect us from hostile aliens wishing to attack. In the end what they did to our planet merely helped us survive. Even if it was only 8 of us. \n",
