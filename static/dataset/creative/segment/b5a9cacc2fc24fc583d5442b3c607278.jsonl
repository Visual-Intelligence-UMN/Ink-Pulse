He knew that he was not safe in his current place of residence, and he had made no plans for another place to go. He then remembered there was a nearby presidential safe house that was to be used for such emergencies only, but he had not used it while during his presidency. Grabbing some essential items, he then left the house and went to the safe house. Not wanting to scare his family and friends nor place them in any danger, he didn't inform anyone that he was going into hiding for the time being.\n\nAfter arriving at the safe house, Obama settled in and began to watch the news and social media in order to get a better idea of what was going on. He could not find anything that suggested his life was in danger, and he began to ponder if he was being too paranoid. It was a possibility he thought, that he wasn't in danger, and that Ben was simply wrong that their lives were in danger. But something inside him told him that Ben was right, and so he settled in for a long time. After a while, he received a text from an unmarked number. The text simply read to \"Sit tight for now; you're fine.\"\n\nWondering if it was from Ben, Obama felt a bit more relieved that he made the right choice. In the safe house, he was safe from any danger that currently threatened his life, even if he didn't know what that may be. The safe house was well stocked on basic necessities, so he didn't have to worry about food or water for the next days, but he still wondered when it would be safe to exit the safe house. Five days later he would get a more definitive answer on what was going on, as the news reported that certain US politicians were being targeted and killed. Realizing his friend was right, and that he was potentially a target, he felt relieved he had chosen to hide out at the safe house. \n\nAfter a few days, the news reports began to calm down, and it seemed that things were going back to normal. Those responsible were apprehended and would face legal justice. Obama left the safe house and returned home to his worried family. His wife and kids were relieved to see him safe, and they all hugged him. He got into contact with Ben Rhodes, who was glad to see he followed his instructions. \n",
