Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the \"Lost Generations\" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.\n\nHowever, you can purchase this pill on the black market. You have to weigh the pros and cons. You're also taking a risk because you are high risk as you're older than 26 years of age.\n\nYou know that this pill will allow you to live until you're 85. That's a longer life than most people get. \n\nHowever, the side effects are pretty serious. These side effects kick in once you turn 85 years old and they involve muscle atrophy, frequent diarrhea and nausea as well as headaches.\n\nYou weigh the pros and cons. You want to live as long as possible. You understand there is risk too. You understand that the end of your life will be very difficult and won't be enjoyable whatsoever. \n\nYou decide to take the pill and luckily don't experience any issues. You start to take risks that you previously wouldn't knowing that you're immortal until the age of 85. You no longer have fears. \n\nYou know that the end of your life isn't going to be fun. Nobody wants to have those side effects. Nobody wants to experience discomfort at the end of your life. However, you know that going in and still prefer having a guarantee of 85 years. 85 years of immortality is a ton of time to do everything that you could dream of and even things that you once believed would be impossible.\n\nTaking the pill was risky. Sometimes the risk is worth the reward. Risks and rewards are different for everyone.\n\n",
