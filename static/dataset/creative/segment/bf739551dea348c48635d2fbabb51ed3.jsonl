You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you will all begin watching your next life on the big screen.\n\nThere is a smell of buttery popcorn around. It is tantalizing, smelling better than anything you've ever smelled on Earth. You look for the source. There are versions of you, relaxing in their seats,, with large golden buckets of popcorn, with a strange sparkle. You get up out of your seat and approach one of the people with the buckets. \n\n\"Excuse me\", you say. \"What is that sparkling stuff on your popcorn?\" The other version of you smiles. \"It's a magic powder., given to us as karma for being good in previous lifetimes\" \"Magic powder?\", you ask, confused. \"You can sprinkle it on anything and make it better.\" He smiles and hands you the whole bucket. \"Try some!\"  \nYou do, and it's true. You suddenly feel like you can do anything: talk to anyone, learn anything, love anyone. You've never felt like this.\n\nYou have a sudden thought. What if you sprinkle it on yourself? You do this, and suddenly you are no longer sitting in a cinema.\nYou are sitting on an unfamiliar beach, but it looks like the beach from your dreams. The man who shared his popcorn with you is beside you, watching the sky.  You glance up. The sky is beautiful, but then you see the movie begin to play. It's like an Aurora Borealis, 4d, better than any movie you have ever seen. \n\nYou nudge the man, as the intro begins. \"Thanks for the powder\", you say. \n",
