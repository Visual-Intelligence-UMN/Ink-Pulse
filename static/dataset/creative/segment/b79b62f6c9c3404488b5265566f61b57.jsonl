They began to fight back. One by one they started to eliminate the elf population. The elves had a large advantage in numbers, but that didn't matter. The humans were too strong and had too powerful of weaponry. The elves were losing their power and the humans were gaining it. The remaining elves decided to make a peace agreement with the humans. They would give up 70% of their land and keep 30% of their land. \n",
