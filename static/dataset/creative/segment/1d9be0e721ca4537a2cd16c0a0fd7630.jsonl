The second thing you notice is that you have a lot of bees around you, all of them bowing. Not too shabby.\n\nYou go out to run some errands, and find a swarm of bees following you. You're not sure how you feel about this. You head into the bank to make a deposit. The teller looks at you funny, and you realize that you're covered in bees. Then you hear screams, and there is a rush for the exits. You realize that the bees have stung everyone in the bank, and you're the only one left.\n\nHmmmm.\n\nYou look down, and notice an opened drawer with stacks of crisp hundred dollar bills. You glance up, expecting to see a security camera. It is there, but the lens is smeared with honey. You grab some cash and run. The bees follow you.\n\nYou're not sure what to do with all this money. You decide to buy a new car. You head to the Mercedes dealership. The salesman looks at you funny, and you realize that you're covered in bees again. Terrifies, the salesman hands you a set of keys, gestures at a nearby car and says something about a test drive. You get in a car and drive away, a million and one bees in the back seat.\n\nLet's see. You are now flush with cash, driving a fancy car, and the leader of an amoral swarm of pretty scary insects. What's next?\n\nYou decide to go to the mall. Soon, you have several trendy outfits. You also have a lot of bees. After a long and active day, you feel very tired. The bees seems tired too. You head back to your new house, and the bees follow. You get in bed, and the bees get in bed with you. You fall asleep, and they fall asleep.\n\nThe next morning, you wake up to find that you have been stung. The room goes dim. You don't see any bees. You feel very, very tired. Being a bee majesty is not all its cracked up to be. \n\nThe room is empty and silent. You fall asleep, for the last time. \n",
