This is a story about the 92nd little pig.\n\nThe 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, \"dude.\" \nThe 92nd little pig said, \"I'm not afraid of you. My name is Felicia Squiggletail the 5th, and you're not allowed in this house!\"\nThe wolf said, \"I'm going to huff and puff and blow your house in, and then eat your for dinner!\" \nFelicia laughed, \"I don't think so, wolf. Wait one minute, and then I'll come outside.\" \nThe wolf agreed, thinking about the foolish pig, and how he was going to have a free meal. \n\nWhen the wolf was waiting, Felicia called the 92nd little pig's friends, the 91st little pig and the 90th little pig. Though the wolf should have known that she was an amazing chemist and creator of gadgets because of how she safely built her house from uranium, Felicia possessed mechanical skills that would literally blow him away.  \n\nIn her spare time, Felicia had thought about how to appropriately punish the evil wolf for eating her brothers and sisters. She had developed 3 very large fans, mounted on the front of rocket packs. The current from the fans could pick up large objects, like a wolf, while the rocket packs would let the pigs hover safely out of his reach.  91 and 90 each had a set, just like her. \n\nThe wolf heard a noise in the distance. It was the 90th and 91st pig coming. He smelled them, and was very angry; he was going to eat them too! The wolf was so angry, he forgot about Felicia. She came out of the house, rocket pack on, and turned on the fans. The wolf was picked up, and the pigs flew away to the river nearby,, wolf trapped in the 3 gushing streams of air. \n",
