When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. Only this time it is not a force of destruction. It is a power of creation.  As the  numbers of humans left alive dwindle,  the old effects of Mana have begun to return, and the ability to wield powers has begun to re-kindle in some individuals . But the process is too slow help humanity as a whole.  So to accelerate the process, a group of survivors have begun to experiment with ways of artificially accelerating the growth of Mana.\n\nThey hit upon an ingenious stratagem: in order to grow stronger, they need to expose a single human to all the world's mana, and tap into the energy of that single human soul. They develop a chamber made of a material that can contain mana, and a brave individual volunteers to remain inside.  This chamber is called the Transference Chamber. The volunteer who will receive all the mana, will be known as the Conduit.\n\nSo as alien bombardment continues, and the situation growing increasingly perilous, mana flows into the Transference Chamber, and the Conduit absorbs it. The effects are rapid. The Conduit rapidly begins to evolve, becoming a Mana user capable of superhuman feats of magic. These powers grow as the mana exposure continues, and very quickly, he reaches a level of power that might be sufficient to tap. The experimenters release him from the Transference Chamber.\n\nBut there is one problem. The Conduit refuses to have his soul tapped.  His power, as well as his thought, have evolved beyond human ken. \n",
