You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. \n\nI turned to the version of myself sitting right next to me and I asked what was going on. That version explained that we all sit here and watch how the next version performs in life and we all evaluate it. It is fun and we get to sometimes vote on what the next version will do. It makes for an interactive experience. Curious about this, I ask why I didn't feel like that happened when I was living the life. The version of myself explained that I did experience that, but when I was living it these moments just felt like epiphanies to me. This explanation made sense to me. \n\nI looked around the theater and while everyone had the same face as me, they were all dressed in their era appropriate clothing. There was a huge variety of people in the theater. The youngest must have been in their early 40's or so and the oldest were over 200.  Everyone began to notice me and I was introduced to the people next to me. Everyone greeted me happily and said that they were proud of what they viewed in my movie. I was at first creeped out, but then realized that that is what we do here and everyone here saw my entire life. I told them that they were all right, and I was proud of it too. \n\nI asked my neighbor if we sit here for all eternity and he explained that no, we do not. We watch the movie and sometimes we get the chance to hop into the next life if our number is picked in the raffle. He told me not to worry because time passes by really quickly in this theater. My neighbor explained that we all have a number on our back and he said that most people pick a number to represent them in their next life. I looked at my own back and saw my number. I asked my neighbor how long he's been in the theater and he said he didn't know. There was no concept of time here and he's just happy to sit back and enjoy the movie.\n\nI looked at the screen, which was still black and asked when the movie was going to start. He told me that the overlords are still picking a candidate to live the movie but it shouldn't be much longer. I was actually excited to see my next life, the whole concept seemed fascinating to me.\n\nA few moment later, a big spotlight appears in the sky and beamed at a seat a few rows ahead of me. A version of me dressed in clothing from seemingly the 12 century was sitting down and he got excited. His number was chosen.   The other versions in the theater began to cheer him on and he was very happy. \n\nThis version began to float in the air and in a flash, he disappeared into a ball of light that hurdled towards the screen. The screen lit up in a flash and a timer appeared. It was counting down from 30 seconds and we could hear sounds. It sounded like a hospital room, and a distant voice of a doctor could be heard. \n\nEveryone in the theater was quiet and we were all excited to see how the next version lives his life.\n",
