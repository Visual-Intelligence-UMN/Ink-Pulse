The elderly can replenish for around twenty four hour or so.  At least that's what I was told, as I haven't seen any elderly since the aliens have declared war against us. We call them the 'Tyrants' as they are the reason why humanity has been reduced to a mere 1% of the population.\n\nThe Tyrants had the majority of us got killed for quite such a short time. They were powerful, and they were ruthless. But when humans started to glow, we realize we could fight back. Every human has a unique power. Some can control the elements, some can manipulate the weather, and some can even heal. I did not know my power until I was attacked by a Tyrant. I had a huge cut in my arm and I was bleeding out. To stop the Tyrant from further attacks, I tried to imagine a wall of stone blocking the alien from me. Suddenly, the ground started to shake and a huge wall of stone rose from the ground. The Tyrant was trapped in the stone, and I was safe. \n\nMy friend, named Harry, was a fire manipulator. He told me that I was a 'Stone Shaper'. We fought together against the Tyrants.  I developed feelings for Harry, and during a particular night patrol we kissed. \n\nI still couldn't believe he's gone. I was in the middle of a battle yesterday with a Tyrant when Harry came to my rescue. His heart was pierced by a Tyrant's blade. I crushed that tyrant with a boulder, and I screamed in agony when I saw Harry's body.\n",
