Upon closer inspection, the investigators could not find anything that could explain why all the citizens of the country of Larkinson had vanished. No evidence of natural disasters, no destruction of their buildings, and no records of what happened during the seven years of isolation were found. The investigators could not find any clues as to what happened to the country, and they disclosed their findings to the UN, ultimately confirming that the country of Larkinson was no more. The nations of the world mourned the loss of the country, and ultimately set up a day to acknowledge the travesty that befell it.\n\nThat isn't to say that the mourning lasted forever, as the other countries of the world begin to excavate and acquire the resources of Larkinson, having made an agreement to share the Larkinsonite they would find among each other. Sure enough, the Larkinsonite was excavated from the ground, and the countries of the world began to use it to their advantage.
