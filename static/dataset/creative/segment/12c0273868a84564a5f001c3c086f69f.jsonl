Where did you even get the uranium from? I have no idea how to blow that down.\n\nThe 92nd little pig was ecstatic because he had solved the issue that the wolf couldn't fix. All of his brethren before had their houses blown down. He outsmarted the wolf. He had a house of super strength. And there was nothing the wolf could do about it. At least he thought.\n\nWhat the little pig didn't know is that the wolf was good friends with a scientist. He went to the scientist and asked the scientist if he knew what could destroy the material uranium.\n\nThe scientist told the wolf that the only thing that could destroy the home was fire. The wolf thought hard about this because while he was cruel and wanted to destroy the pigs homes', he wanted to do it without harming any of the pigs.\n\nOne day when the little pig was out looking for food the wolf saw a golden opportunity. He could light the home on fire and destroy the 92nd little pigs home. \n\nThe wolf had a match and lit it. He threw the match at the home and nothing happened. The wolf was confused and lit another match and threw it at the home. Again nothing happened. \n\nThe little pig strolled by and walked up to the wolf. He explained that this wasn't typical uranium. It's a special type of uranium that can't be destroyed. The wolf was so angry. He had to go back to the drawing board. \n\nThe little pig had won this battle. He had outsmarted the wolf. He told all of his other pig friends and had them build their homes out of uranium as well. For now, the pigs finally had gotten their revenge on the wolf and there was nothing he could do about it. \n",
