You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. It's sort of a thrill to you, because you had no idea that you would be reincarnated as a white woman named Soeurette in your next life.\n\nAfter all, you've always thought of yourself as a black man with a football player's build so it's a little odd to you that in your future life you're going to have long blonde hair, green eyes, and a thin, petite body. Soeurette is a very attractive woman, and she's unfortunately not a very nice person. She's a spoiled brat who is always looking for a way to get her way. \n\nShe's also a very jealous person. Her fiance, Matt, is a nice guy, but Soeurette is always finding ways to make him jealous. For example, on her bachelorette party to Cartagena, Soeurette is out with her friends and she meets a guy named Carlos. She flirts with him and goes to his hotel room with him. And in the hotel room, she makes out with him and then she tells him that she's engaged to be married to a man named Matt. This only turns Carlos on more, because he's a man who likes to have his way with women who are already taken. So, the two of them spend the night together. They don't just kiss, they go further than that.\n\nThe next morning, Soeurette goes back to her hotel room and her friends ask her if she had a good time. Soeurette responds that she had a great time. She doesn't feel guilty about it at all. But the thing is, is that Carlos posts pictures of their encounter on Facebook, and Matt sees them. Matt is very upset by this, and he confronts Soeurette about it. Soeurette tells him that he has no right to be upset, because she's not his wife yet.\n\nThat kind of thinking is obviously not going to lead to a happy marriage, but Soeurette doesn't care. Upon realizing how selfish and shallow Soeurette is, Matt breaks off the engagement. Soeurette is devastated, and she goes to her father, who is a very wealthy man, and asks him for money so that she can go to Cartagena again to see Carlos. Her father gives her the money, and Soeurette goes back to Cartagena. It's too bad, though, because Carlos has already moved on and he's not interested in Soeurette anymore. In fact, when she arrives in Cartagena, he's already got another girl with him, and he announces that she is his new girlfriend.\n\nSoeurette thus realizes she's going to have to pay for her actions. She is now alone. She doesn't have Matt anymore and she doesn't have Carlos. She's going to have to live the rest of her life without a man. This is not going to bode well for her, because she's a very materialistic person. She's used to having all the things she wants. Soeurette ends up committing suicide, and she's reincarnated as a man named Pierre.\n",
