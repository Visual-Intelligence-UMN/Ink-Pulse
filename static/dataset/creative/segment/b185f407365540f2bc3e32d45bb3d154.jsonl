        "text": "Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had one hundred little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.\n\nThe 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, \"dude.\" He paused. \"That's way south of cool, don't you think?\"  The 92nd little pig said, \"I'm not trying to be cool, I'm trying to be safe.\" The wolf nodded evenly. \"I dig it dude, but have you ever thought about mellowing out a little?\"  The 92nd little pig said, \"I'm not trying to mellow out, I'm trying to survive.\" The wolf shrugged. \"Sure, you're surviving, but have you ever really tried LIVING?\" He looked at the house with disgust. \"That's not living.\"\n\nThe pig thought about this for a moment. He thought about the pigs who had gone before him, and how they had all built their houses out of straw, sticks, and bricks. About the futility of it all, and how they had spent their lives, building and building, and how it had all come to nothing. Sure, they'd prevented themselves from becoming a wolf's dinner, but in the process they had lost everything that made them who they were. They'd lived empty lives, bitter, and alone, and afraid. The pig decided that he'd rather be a wolf's dinner than live a life like that.\n\nSo he turned to the wolf and asked \"What do you suggest?\" The wolf said \"Let's start slow, dude, let's go out and get some pizza.\" \"What's pizza?\" asked the pig. \"It's this thing that humans eat, it's really good.\" He looked at the pig again. \"Man oh man, you've got a lot to learn.\"\n\nSo, the wolf and the pig thumbed a ride into town from some dirty hippies in a rusty van, and got some pizza. They ordered an extra large pie, with everything on it, and wolfed it down and/or pigged it up.  \"Wow, that was really good.\" said the pig. \"I especially liked the ham, and what was that other stuff?\" \"Pepperoni.\" said the wolf. \"What's that made of?\" asked the pig. \"Oh, don't worry about it.\" said the wolf.\n\nThen the wolf and the pig went to a bar and got a couple of beers,  and the wolf said \"You know, I've been thinking about your house.\" \n",

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.\n\nThe 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, \"dude.\" He paused. \"That's way south of cool, don't you think?\"  The 92nd little pig said, \"I'm not trying to be cool, I'm trying to be safe.\" The wolf nodded evenly. \"I dig it dude, but have you ever thought about mellowing out a little?\"  The 92nd little pig said, \"I'm not trying to mellow out, I'm trying to survive.\" The wolf shrugged. \"Sure, you're surviving, but have you ever really tried LIVING?\" He looked at the house with disgust. \"That's not living.\"\n\nThe pig thought about this for a moment. He thought about the pigs who had gone before him, and how they had all built their houses out of straw, sticks, and bricks. About the futility of it all, and how they had spent their lives, building and building, and how it had all come to nothing. Sure, they'd prevented themselves from becoming a wolf's dinner, but in the process they had lost everything that made them who they were. They'd lived empty lives, bitter, and alone, and afraid. The pig decided that he'd rather be a wolf's dinner than live a life like that.\n\nSo he turned to the wolf and asked \"What do you suggest?\" The wolf said \"Let's start slow, dude, let's go out and get some pizza.\" \"What's pizza?\" asked the pig. \"It's this thing that humans eat, it's really good.\" He looked at the pig again. \"Man oh man, you've got a lot to learn.\"\n\nSo, the wolf and the pig thumbed a ride into town from some dirty hippies in a rusty van, and got some pizza. They ordered an extra large pie, with everything on it, and wolfed it down and/or pigged it up.  \"Wow, that was really good.\" said the pig. \"I especially liked the ham, and what was that other stuff?\" \"Pepperoni.\" said the wolf. \"What's that made of?\" asked the pig. \"Oh, don't worry about it.\" said the wolf.\n\nThen the wolf and the pig went to a bar and got a couple of beers,  which totally wowed the pig, and the wolf said \"You know, I've been thinking about your house.\" \"What about it?\" asked the pig. \"It's no place to live, but it'd be a shame to let it completely go to waste.\" \"What do you want to do with it?\" asked the pig.\n\n\"Well, pizza, and beer, cost money, and those hippies who gave us a ride look like spoiled rich kids slumming it, bet they've got some.\"  \"You want to rob them?\" asked the pig? \"Sort of.\" said the wolf. \"I want to rent your place to them.\"\n\nSo, they went to the hippies' van, and the wolf told them about the great place he had for rent, and the hippies were like \"Dude, sweet.\" And the pig and the wolf soaked them for rent for years, and while the wolf drifted off to other careers, the pig became a huge real estate and construction magnate. And that, is the story of how Donald Trump got his start in business.\n",
