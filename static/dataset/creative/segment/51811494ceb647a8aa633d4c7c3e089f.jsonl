She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. \n\nThe Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit. Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.\n\nThe doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler. \n\nSoeurette commandeered an army of tanks and stormed Tyler's abode. Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces. And that was the end of Soeurette's strategy to take over the world as supreme leader of the U.S. Empire. Her plans were never able to come fully to fruition because of her own emotional instability and thorny romantic past. \n\nTyler, as the new ruler of the U.S. Empire, had to deal with his ex-wife's demise. However, Tyler was smarter than Soeurette had been, and he generally had a more calm and steady demeanor. He immediately passed resolutions that increased the U.S.'s connections and ties with other states, rather than threatening to blockade them all. He also immediately repealed all legislation that would have created a global dictatorship. The other countries were grateful that Soeurette was out and that Tyler was in. And so began a very prosperous era for the new U.S. Empire. \n",
