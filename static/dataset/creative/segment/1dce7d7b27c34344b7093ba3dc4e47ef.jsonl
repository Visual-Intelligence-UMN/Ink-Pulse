She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time.\n\nToday was the day. He and Valarie had been dating for almost a year. Well, this time around. This was the 4th time they dated, but all of the other times they had crashed and burned after less than 8 months. So he was certain that this was the right face.   He had it all planned out. He bought a ring, made the dinner reservations, and rented out the observation deck of her favorite city viewing spot. \n\nIt was hard being a shapeshifter. Once you started changing, even just once, there was so much to keep track of, and so much work to do to create a new \"you\". It was a lot of work to keep track of all the details of your life, and to make sure that you didn't leave any evidence of your past, while still maintaining a legal identity. Not that his current one was technically \"legal\". He had been born in a small town in the Midwest, and had been a \"normal\" guy until he had been in a car accident. They had expected horrible scarring, and were surprised there was none. But he didn't look like he had either. In fact, he suddenly grew 3 inches, and looked and awful like the popular actor of the time, the one all the girls in his class had been gushing over. At first he thought he had the best luck, but then he realized the changes just freaked every one out. He was a freak, and he had to leave town. One day a woman he was interested in told him she preferred brunettes. When he woke up the next morning his hair color was different, and there were changes to his face. And that's when he knew. He could control this.\n\nWhich came in handy when he met Valarie. They dated for about 3 months the first time, then she broke up with him when he flirted with another woman. He realized his mistake, but she just wouldn't take him back. So he changed. He wasn't really certain why the other times he dated her didn't work out. Maybe it was the fact that he was a bit of a playboy, and she wasn't. He didn't cheat, but who doesn't like attention? But this time, it seemed like she accepted him for what he was, and this time he was going to get to marry her.\n\nDinner was strangely tense, which he had not been expected. He asked about her day, but all she would say was that she had an extra long session with her therapist, and they could talk about it later. He thought that was weird, but they were in a restaurant; maybe she didn't want to get emotional there? He had been looking forward to this night for a long time, and he was determined to make it special.\n\nThey went to the observation deck, and if anything the atmosphere got even more intense. \n",
