The maid flicks the bee with the towel, and it flies off. \"Oh, thank you, thank you, I can't believe you got it off me.\" I say, as I run back to the party. \n\n\"That was weird\", I hear the maid say. \"I've never seen someone react like that to a bee before.\"\n\"I'm not surprised\", the other maid says. \"She's always been a bit of a weirdo.\" She leans conspiratorially close. \"She is on a new medication, and has been hearing voices lately\" \"I heard that too\", the first maid says.\n\nI leap to my feet. There is no way I will let servants talk to me like that! I run back to the deck, and grab the first maid by the hair. \"How dare you talk about me like that!\" I scream, as I pull her to the ground. \"I am the queen, and you will show me respect!\" \n\n\"I'm sorry, Your Majesty\", the maid says, as she tries to get up. I kick her in the stomach, and she falls back to the ground. \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!\" she screams. \n\n\"I'm not done with you yet\", I say, as I grab her by the neck. \"You will never disrespect me again, or I will have you executed.\" I let go of her, and she crawls away. \"Now, I'm going back to my party.\" \n\nI walk back to the party, and the guests are all staring at me. \"What are you looking at?\" I say. \"I was just teaching a servant a lesson.\" \n\"I think you should go back to your room\", my husband says. \"You've been acting really strange lately.\" \n\"I'm fine, I'm fine\", I say. \"I'm just going to go get a drink.\" \n\nI walk over to the bar, and the bartender hands me a drink. I don't notice that my husband has my meds in hand, and slips them into my drink. I take a sip, and I feel a wave of calm wash over me. I feel so much better, so much more relaxed.\n",

Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\"\n\nTrigger warning: Violence,  AI portrayal of mental illness\n\nI jump, startled. \"It's a bee, get it off me!\" I scream, as I run to the servants on the deck.  I knock over the small woman who was standing behind me.  I didn't even notice her before. \"Stand still\", the maid says in her tiny voice, as she grab a towel. \"We'll just get it off you, and then you can go back to your party.\" \n\n\"No, no, no, I can't be near it!\" I scream.
