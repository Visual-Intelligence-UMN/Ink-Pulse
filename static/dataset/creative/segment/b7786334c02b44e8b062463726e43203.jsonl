I ran for 2 miles down our back road  \n\nI was running for my life. I was so scared. I was running so fast, I didn't know where I was going. I ended up running into a tree and I fell down. After I ran into the tree I passed out and woke up in the hospital. I was in the hospital for 3 days. I ended up with a small amount of brain damage and now I'm deaf in my left ear.\n\nI finally returned home from the hospital, I was so happy to be home. I was so happy to be back with my family. I will never forget that day I ran away from the Bee. I will never forget the day I ran into the tree. I will never forget the day I got brain damage. I will never forget the day I got deaf in my left ear.\n",
