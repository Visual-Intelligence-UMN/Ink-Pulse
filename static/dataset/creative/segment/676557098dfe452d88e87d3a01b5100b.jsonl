Everyone is one their best behavior. It's almost like the weeks approaching Christmas, when everyone is being good in order to impress Santa Claus. \n\nThe dads are all trying to get the #1 spot. But only one dad can have the #1 spot, and only one dad can come in dead last.  The mugs will be released the morning of Father's Day. That is only 2 weeks away. Barbershops are bustling with dads getting their last-minute haircuts. Suit shops are busy with men looking to dress their best for the big day. Flower shops are bringing in lots of money from all the dads buying flowers for their wives. \n\nThe dads are all in a frenzy. They all want to be #1. There are rumors about the top candidates for the winning spot. There's Mister Jones, from the county seat. He's a lawyer, and he's a good dad. His contender and neighbor, Mister Smith, is a doctor. He is also a good dad too. What numbers will they get when the mugs arrive? \n\nThe morning of the big day finally arrives. It's Father's Day. The dads are all up early. They wait eagerly for their mugs to be delivered to their doorsteps. They are all anxious to see what the mugs will say. They wait and they wait.  Minutes turn into hours. No sign of the mugs. \n",
