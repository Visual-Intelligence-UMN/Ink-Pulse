He remembers what his grandfather always used to say \"Let sleeping dogs lie\".\n\nThe next evening his girlfriend starts to talk about a long-term commitment, marriage, children.  He starts to sweat.  Children, there'd be a 50/50 chance they'd be a shape-changer and that would let the cat out of the bag for certain.  He knows he has to make some decisions.\n\nHe tossed and he turned all night.  I want to be with her he decided.  I am going to break up with in my current form and then I will return to her in another shape.  I know she'll accept me and I won't have to chance a permanent rupture.  And that's what he did!\n",
