All that's left is to create plan and execute it. \n\nThe plan is to create a magical barrier that will prevent the aliens from entering the planet and to do that they need to gather a lot humans who have the power to create shields, but before they can execute that plan, they have to kill the remaining aliens on planet Earth first which is handled by the most powerful warriors of Nathosilum. Their warriors are employed of various powers such as controlling certain elements such as water, fire, earth and air, but the most powerful of them is a warrior named, Sithilius who controls dark matter. This power of controlling dark matter is the single most power element that can be used against the aliens since these aliens are from an alternate universe that is made up of 0.00001% more dark matter than everything within our universe. That small microscopic difference is all the difference and the aliens don't know that Sithilius has that power.\n\nNathosilum has gathered everyone that they need and Sithilius has begun to eliminate all aliens on the planet. He's so powerful that he can concentrate his energy and manipulate all dark matter on the planet and recognize whether they're aliens are not since he can sense that tiny bit difference of dark matter that aliens have. It takes him much of his energy and concentration but within 16 hours he manages to wipe all of aliens on the planet. Then the next group of warriors create the barrier around the planet which will be permanent unless some stronger force breaks it. Sithilius reinforces the barrier with his anti-dark matter manipulations so that no alien can cross without being destroyed, and finally, Nathosilum, the magical warriors of the planet Earth, have gained their planet and freedom back!\n",
