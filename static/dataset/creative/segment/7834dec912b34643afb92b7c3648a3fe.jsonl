After one day the man started regaining his health. The patient was very thankful and promised to pay me back. I told him it was not necessary since I knew it would be very hard for him to pay me. I left the village and continued on with my journey. The next day I was called to another village for work. This time it was a sick woman who needed medicine. She had been sick for a whole week. I was still thinking about the patient from the previous day. \"What if she also can't afford medicine?\", I wondered. But I decided to treat the woman anyway. I treated her for a few days, and the woman started feeling better.\n",
