        "text": "The Next Generation of Social Media Marketing\n\n\n\nSocial media marketing has come a long way from its humble beginnings. It only makes sense that it would also change as the audiences that are being targeted, and the platforms on which they use social media, do. If your business is still operating under a strategy that's quite similar to social media marketing in the pre-2010 era, it's time for you to get out of the Prehistoric Age, and move into the future. \n\nSocial media marketing has evolved from a simple presence on Facebook and other social networks to an incredibly valuable way to connect with customers, prospects, and communities in a real-time way. Mobile communication technologies enable us to remain connected to the people that matter the most, no matter where we are or what we’re doing. Companies can now keep their customers and prospects engaged throughout the entire lifecycle of their purchase journey, from initial awareness to purchase and beyond. Social media and mobile technologies can be used to increase sales, build brand recognition, and ultimately generate profit.\n\nSocial media marketing is a great way for businesses to reach customers, build brand awareness, and create relationships. Social media marketing can be done for many different platforms and can range from very simple to complex. Many businesses, especially small businesses, use social media to promote their products and services. \n\nSocial media have proven to be a valuable source of traffic for many websites. For instance, according to a HubSpot 2010 Survey, 72% of marketers use social media for content distribution. Furthermore, a 2012 survey by Social Media Examiner found that 94% of marketers worldwide use social media for business. In addition, a report by the same company found that 74% of marketers say that social media has helped them personally connect with customers.\n",
