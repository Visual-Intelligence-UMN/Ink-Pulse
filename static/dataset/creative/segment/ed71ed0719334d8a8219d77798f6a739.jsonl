Obtaining Mana is the only way to ensure the survival of the people. Now, three young students discover a secret that may change everything... They discover the Mana Cave. \n\nThe Mana Cave is the original source of all Mana. Not only does it store infinite amounts of Mana, but simply being near the cave makes any person stronger and superior. The Mana Cave is the key to victory. \n\nThe cave is protected by a magical seal that only allows people of the purest hearts and truest intentions to enter. Many have fallen by trying to enter the cave. And those who have made it inside have never returned. No one knows just how much Mana is inside because no one exits the cave once inside. It is full of legends and lore. \n\nSome believe the cave is a myth.  The only way to prove its existence is to enter the cave and return to the outside world with evidence. This is what the three friends have set out to do. They are determined to make it into the cave and back out alive. \n\nThey succeed in entering the cave. But they quickly discover that the cave is more than what it seems. Right from the beginning, it seemed like forces of nature were playing with them. But once they enter the cave, things change. Walls seemed to change shape, and lights would appear and then disappear. Soon they find themselves in a mysterious place and realize they are not alone. They heard voices telling them where to go. They didn't know if they should trust the voices, but they had no other choice. They were lost. \n\nThe friends find themselves at a place known as the Throne Room. The throne in the middle of the room is empty. But then, the throne begins to shake and a light fills the room. From the light comes a loud, booming voice. It said, \"I am the guardian of this cave. Are you here to guard the cave?\" \n\n\"No,\" the three friends replied. \"We were just exploring.\"\n\n\"You are not here to guard the cave?\" the voice said. \"We are in need of someone new to watch over the cave. If not you, then who?\" \n\nWithout hesitation, one of the friends stepped forward.\n",
