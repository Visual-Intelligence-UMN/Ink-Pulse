There was a lot of information to process. He explained that do defeat the aliens we had to dig up a time crystal from the past, which to me, was now. Then we had to take it to the future and use it in conjunction with their own time crystals to create a super time crystal that would send out a signal that would destroy the aliens ability to rule over us. \"So where do we dig?\", I asked JFK.\n\n\"Oh, outside my secret time machine base.\", he replied. So we got our shovels and started to dig. \n\nIt wasn't long before we struck the time crystal and successfully unearthed it. \"We have to get this time crystal back to the future.\", I said.\n",
