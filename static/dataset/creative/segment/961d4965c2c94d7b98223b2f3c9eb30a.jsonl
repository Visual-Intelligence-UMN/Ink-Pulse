Suddenly, a flash can be seen in the earpiece and sucked Obama into the phone. Obama travelled into the phone lines and all he saw was a flash of colors before he landed on hard ground. Standing where he landed was the one and only JFK. \"Hello, Obama. We've been expecting you. Follow me.\"\n\nHe got back on his feet and followed JFK to the oval office. \"Please, take a seat, Mr. Obama.\" he said. \"Why, why am I here?\" questioned Obama. \"You're here because our world is in danger.\" JFK replied. \"In danger of what?\" asked Obama. \"You have to listen very carefully. The world is in danger of\n\n\n\"Goku arriving in the Future.\"\n\n\"Goku?\" asked Obama even more confused. \"And how are you alive, and how am I in here?\" Obama suddenly questioning the reality of the situation.\n\n\"Goku is the son of Bardock and Raditz, and he travels to the future in order to eliminate the earth.\" said JFK. \"And the phone is a portal from your era back to our timeline. We need you to stop him, Obama.\"\n\n\"What?! How can I stop him!\" Obama asked as he stands up from his sleep next to his daughter in their bedroom watching TV, where an anime with the character Goku is showing on the TV.\n",
