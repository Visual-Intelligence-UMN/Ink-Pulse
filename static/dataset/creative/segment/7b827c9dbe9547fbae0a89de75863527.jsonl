It was a shock to find that the US was alone in the world except for small pockets of survivors.  He decided that he would keep searching and bring survivors together if they wanted, or leave them be if not.  He also started sending teams out figure out what natural resources the US could benefit from in the abandoned countries.  They looked for technologies that might have been discovered as well.  As this occurred, more survivors were found, especially on islands that hadn't been obvious during the war.  \n\nOver the next few years, Americans had the opportunity to populate other countries.  This was good because during the period of isolation, the population had boomed.  American had been a country build on immigrants, and now they were having people immigrate from their shores for new opportunities.  People had the opportunity to live in areas that they had only read about - Caribbean islands, on the canals of Venice, in the snow covered peaks of the Alps.  While a terrible thing had happened, American spirit kept going.\n",
