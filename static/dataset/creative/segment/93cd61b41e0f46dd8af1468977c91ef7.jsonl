To be able to lead a nation of people toward a brighter, bigger future, contains some of my proudest memories of my life. I was now retired after my presidential tenure, looking to occupy my time with family and hobbies. My wife Michelle, and my kids, Sasha and Malia, were always supportive of my endeavors. I decided to pick up gardening as my hobby during my retirement. It was relaxing and stress free, exactly what the doctor ordered. The summer days were difficult to garden in because of the warm weather, which is why I enjoyed gardening in the early mornings, before the blazing sun had a chance to greet me. After a long day of work, I decided to take a well deserved nap in my bedroom, away from the summer heat. two hours later, I awoke with a grand thirst and reached for my cold, water bottle on the bedside table. I felt around the table with my eyes half closed, but touched something unfamiliar. I rolled over to see a mysterious letter sitting on the table. That letter was not there when I went to bed, it had no return address; nevertheless, it was clearly postmarked to me. I called for Michelle, but there was no answer. I forgot that she was planning on taking the girls to the beach for the rest of the day, so I had the house all to myself. I reached for my letter opener and to my surprise, it was signed by \"JFK\". I could not believe my eyes, JFK was no longer living. He had been assassinated decades ago under mysterious circumstances. This \"JFK\" knew I was retired and wanted me to call a number, only containing 4 numbers. I will be honest in saying that the letter sent a chill down my spine. Out of curiosity, I reached for my phone and dialed the number. A gruff voice answered and asked me to confirm my identity by pressing my fingerprint on my phone. The man verified my identity and asked me to pack some bags, wanting me to meet him at the airport. I packed quickly, left a note for Michelle and was on my way to the airport. \n",

        "text": "You're Barack Obama. 4 years into your retirement, you awake to find a letter with no return address on your bedside table. It reads \"I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job.\" Signed simply, \"JFK.\"\n\nMy presidency of 8 years was one of the most stressful, but rewarding experiences of my life. To be able to lead a nation of people toward a brighter, bigger future, contains some of my proudest memories of my life. I was now retired after my presidential tenure, looking to occupy my time with family and hobbies. My wife Michelle, and my kids, Sasha and Malia, were always supportive of my endeavors. I decided to pick up gardening as my hobby during my retirement. It was relaxing and stress free, exactly what the doctor ordered. The summer days were difficult to garden in because of the warm weather, which is why I enjoyed gardening in the early mornings, before the blazing sun had a chance to greet me. After a long day of work, I decided to take a well deserved nap in my bedroom, away from the summer heat. two hours later, I awoke with a grand thirst and reached for my cold, water bottle on the bedside table. I felt around the table with my eyes half closed, but touched something unfamiliar. I rolled over to see a mysterious letter sitting on the table. That letter was not there when I went to bed, it had no return address; nevertheless, it was clearly postmarked to me. I called for Michelle, but there was no answer. I forgot that she was planning on taking the girls to the beach for the rest of the day, so I had the house all to myself. I reached for my letter opener and to my surprise, it was signed by \"JFK\". I could not believe my eyes, JFK was no longer living. He had been assassinated decades ago under mysterious circumstances. This \"JFK\" knew I was retired and wanted me to call a number, only containing 4 numbers. I will be honest in saying that the letter sent a chill down my spine. Out of curiosity, I reached for my phone and dialed the number. A gruff voice answered and asked me to confirm my identity by pressing my fingerprint on my phone. The man verified my identity and asked me to pack some bags, wanting me to meet him at the airport. I packed quickly, left a note for Michelle and was on my way to the airport. I stood in the terminal for a few minutes, when a man dressed in a black suit and tie approached me. \"Mr. Obama, please come this way.\" I hesitantly followed the man for I did not know this stranger in the black suit. He lead me to a private plane, with the license plate reading \"The Flying White House\". The man in the black suit opened the door for me, and I entered the plane. The inside of the plane was similar to Air Force One, but more regal. The man in the black suit closed the door and told me to have a seat, \"Mr. Kennedy will be here shortly\". Somehow I had a feeling that this was some joke meant to ease me into my retirement.  I sat down in a leather seat, and waited for JFK to arrive. Fifteen minutes later, a man in a grey suit boards the plane, I could not see his face. He makes his way toward me and I realize that the man is in fact JFK. \n",

        "text": "You're Barack Obama. 4 years into your retirement, you awake to find a letter with no return address on your bedside table. It reads \"I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job.\" Signed simply, \"JFK.\"\n\nMy presidency of 8 years was one of the most stressful, but rewarding experiences of my life. To be able to lead a nation of people toward a brighter, bigger future, contains some of my proudest memories of my life. I was now retired after my presidential tenure, looking to occupy my time with family and hobbies. My wife Michelle, and my kids, Sasha and Malia, were always supportive of my endeavors. I decided to pick up gardening as my hobby during my retirement. It was relaxing and stress free, exactly what the doctor ordered. The summer days were difficult to garden in because of the warm weather, which is why I enjoyed gardening in the early mornings, before the blazing sun had a chance to greet me. After a long day of work, I decided to take a well deserved nap in my bedroom, away from the summer heat. two hours later, I awoke with a grand thirst and reached for my cold, water bottle on the bedside table. I felt around the table with my eyes half closed, but touched something unfamiliar. I rolled over to see a mysterious letter sitting on the table. That letter was not there when I went to bed, it had no return address; nevertheless, it was clearly postmarked to me. I called for Michelle, but there was no answer. I forgot that she was planning on taking the girls to the beach for the rest of the day, so I had the house all to myself. I reached for my letter opener and to my surprise, it was signed by \"JFK\". I could not believe my eyes, JFK was no longer living. He had been assassinated decades ago under mysterious circumstances. This \"JFK\" knew I was retired and wanted me to call a number, only containing 4 numbers. I will be honest in saying that the letter sent a chill down my spine. Out of curiosity, I reached for my phone and dialed the number. A gruff voice answered and asked me to confirm my identity by pressing my fingerprint on my phone. The man verified my identity and asked me to pack some bags, wanting me to meet him at the airport. I packed quickly, left a note for Michelle and was on my way to the airport. I stood in the terminal for a few minutes, when a man dressed in a black suit and tie approached me. \"Mr. Obama, please come this way.\" I hesitantly followed the man for I did not know this stranger in the black suit. He lead me to a private plane, with the license plate reading \"The Flying White House\". The man in the black suit opened the door for me, and I entered the plane. The inside of the plane was similar to Air Force One, but more regal. The man in the black suit closed the door and told me to have a seat, \"Mr. Kennedy will be here shortly\". Somehow I had a feeling that this was some joke meant to ease me into my retirement.  I sat down in a leather seat, and waited for JFK to arrive. Fifteen minutes later, a man in a grey suit boards the plane, I could not see his face. He makes his way toward me and I realize that the man is in fact JFK. I am gobsmacked, this is not a joke. I stood up to shake his hand and to show my respect for a previous president. He sat down across from me and asked, \"do you realize why I have called on you?\". I told him I had no idea what any of this was about, but it must be important to national security. JFK told me that a threat of nuclear war is imminent and I must act accordingly. I told him that I no longer had the power because I was no longer president. I was the wrong person to ask to partake in this job. But JFK argued otherwise, he said that I was the only person who could handle this kind of job. I asked him what he wanted me to do. \n",

But JFK argued otherwise, he said that I was the only person who could handle this kind of job. I asked him what he wanted me to do. JFK dropped a folder on the table in front of me, and told me that he wanted me to read it. The file within revealed that the current president was a robot created by the Russians, to start a nuclear war. JFK showed me a device that looked like a pencil, built to disable the robot and stop the threat. The pencil device was meant to be inserted into the center of the robot's CPU and it would cause him to crash and burn. JFK wanted me to go The White House for a \"visit\", so that I could meet the robot president and disable him. I accepted the mission and shook JFK's hand. I left the plane, which took off quickly into the sky. I called Michelle and left a message, telling her I would be paying a visit to The White House for old times sake. I made my way out of the airport, and to the nearest cab. I arrived at The White House and made my way to the interior. Everyone greeted me as if I had neve left. I soon spotted the robot president and introduced myself again. I asked to talk with him in private away from prying eyes. He agreed and we made our way to his office. \n",

        "text": "You're Barack Obama. 4 years into your retirement, you awake to find a letter with no return address on your bedside table. It reads \"I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job.\" Signed simply, \"JFK.\"\n\nMy presidency of 8 years was one of the most stressful, but rewarding experiences of my life. To be able to lead a nation of people toward a brighter, bigger future, contains some of my proudest memories of my life. I was now retired after my presidential tenure, looking to occupy my time with family and hobbies. My wife Michelle, and my kids, Sasha and Malia, were always supportive of my endeavors. I decided to pick up gardening as my hobby during my retirement. It was relaxing and stress free, exactly what the doctor ordered. The summer days were difficult to garden in because of the warm weather, which is why I enjoyed gardening in the early mornings, before the blazing sun had a chance to greet me. After a long day of work, I decided to take a well deserved nap in my bedroom, away from the summer heat. two hours later, I awoke with a grand thirst and reached for my cold, water bottle on the bedside table. I felt around the table with my eyes half closed, but touched something unfamiliar. I rolled over to see a mysterious letter sitting on the table. That letter was not there when I went to bed, it had no return address; nevertheless, it was clearly postmarked to me. I called for Michelle, but there was no answer. I forgot that she was planning on taking the girls to the beach for the rest of the day, so I had the house all to myself. I reached for my letter opener and to my surprise, it was signed by \"JFK\". I could not believe my eyes, JFK was no longer living. He had been assassinated decades ago under mysterious circumstances. This \"JFK\" knew I was retired and wanted me to call a number, only containing 4 numbers. I will be honest in saying that the letter sent a chill down my spine. Out of curiosity, I reached for my phone and dialed the number. A gruff voice answered and asked me to confirm my identity by pressing my fingerprint on my phone. The man verified my identity and asked me to pack some bags, wanting me to meet him at the airport. I packed quickly, left a note for Michelle and was on my way to the airport. I stood in the terminal for a few minutes, when a man dressed in a black suit and tie approached me. \"Mr. Obama, please come this way.\" I hesitantly followed the man for I did not know this stranger in the black suit. He lead me to a private plane, with the license plate reading \"The Flying White House\". The man in the black suit opened the door for me, and I entered the plane. The inside of the plane was similar to Air Force One, but more regal. The man in the black suit closed the door and told me to have a seat, \"Mr. Kennedy will be here shortly\". Somehow I had a feeling that this was some joke meant to ease me into my retirement.  I sat down in a leather seat, and waited for JFK to arrive. Fifteen minutes later, a man in a grey suit boards the plane, I could not see his face. He makes his way toward me and I realize that the man is in fact JFK. I am gobsmacked, this is not a joke. I stood up to shake his hand and to show my respect for a previous president. He sat down across from me and asked, \"do you realize why I have called on you?\". I told him I had no idea what any of this was about, but it must be important to national security. JFK told me that a threat of nuclear war is imminent and I must act accordingly. I told him that I no longer had the power because I was no longer president. I was the wrong person to ask to partake in this job.

I pulled out the pencil device and asked him to sit in a chair.\n",

I activated the device, shutting down the robot in his chair. I had to get out quickly without being noticed. I went out the back door behind the resolute desk and looked for a cab. My phone rang, JFK called me to congratulate me on a mission well done.  He said I had served my country well once more. He had sent a special car to pick me up and take me home. I got into the car and walked in calmly, seeing Michelle and the girls back from the beach. She asked how my day went and I said \"it could not have gone any better\", with a smirk.  I think I was going to enjoy the rest of my retirement.\n",
