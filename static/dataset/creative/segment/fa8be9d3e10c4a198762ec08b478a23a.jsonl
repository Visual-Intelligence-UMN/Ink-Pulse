        "text": "A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time. \n\nThe film was shot in and around San Francisco and Los Angeles. It's directed by Michael Oates Palmer, who also directed \"Unforgettable\" in 2006. \n\nThe film was released on DVD through New Video in February 2008. The film won a Best Feature Film Award at the 2007 Accolade Film Festival. Needless to say, it's a very popular film among young people in particular, and has also made quite a name for itself among fans of indie movies. If you've ever seen this movie, you may know why.\n\nBasically, the film follows the story of a woman who is struggling with the fact that every guy she's been dating has been cheating on her. Her name is Soeurette and she is constantly finding this guy named Matt to date and to marry. Soeurette is too stupid to realize that Matt is actually the same person. In fact, he doesn't even try to hide the fact that he's the same person. He literally uses the same name, has the same phone number, and makes no changes to his appearance. But every time Soeurette boots Matt out of her life for cheating, she tries her best to forget him, erases him from her contacts, and blocks him from her social media. And as a result, she actually succeeds in forgetting him. Then, he comes back again in the same form, just like how it always happens. She then falls in love all over again. It's a very interesting concept for a film.\n\nThis time, though, Matt wants to make things right. Of course, isn't that what he always says? He wants to finally settle down with Soeurette and give her the life she's been dreaming of. He decides that he's going to delete his Tinder profile, since that was always the source of his problems with Soeurette. It was always too tempting to see so many blondes on Tinder. And now, with his Tinder profile deleted, he has nothing to distract him. He'll be able to focus all his attention on Soeurette. Unfortunately, a friend of Soeurette's tips her off that Matt has actually been the same boyfriend who's cheated on her the last 10 times. Soeurette is so confused as to how she could have been so stupid as to think that this was a different guy each time. Honestly, it's a little concerning that she could have been so naive to believe that a different man would have the same name, phone number, and social media profile as he does. It also makes you wonder what kind of life she's been living. \n\nBut what really pushes Soeurette over the edge is she finds out that Matt has been cheating on her with another one of her girlfriends, named Christelle. \n",

She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time. \n\nThe film was shot in and around San Francisco and Los Angeles. It's directed by Michael Oates Palmer, who also directed \"Unforgettable\" in 2006. \n\nThe film was released on DVD through New Video in February 2008. The film won a Best Feature Film Award at the 2007 Accolade Film Festival. Needless to say, it's a very popular film among young people in particular, and has also made quite a name for itself among fans of indie movies. If you've ever seen this movie, you may know why.\n\nBasically, the film follows the story of a woman who is struggling with the fact that every guy she's been dating has been cheating on her. Her name is Soeurette and she is constantly finding this guy named Matt to date and to marry. Soeurette is too stupid to realize that Matt is actually the same person. In fact, he doesn't even try to hide the fact that he's the same person. He literally uses the same name, has the same phone number, and makes no changes to his appearance. But every time Soeurette boots Matt out of her life for cheating, she tries her best to forget him, erases him from her contacts, and blocks him from her social media. And as a result, she actually succeeds in forgetting him. Then, he comes back again in the same form, just like how it always happens. She then falls in love all over again. It's a very interesting concept for a film.\n\nThis time, though, Matt wants to make things right. Of course, isn't that what he always says? He wants to finally settle down with Soeurette and give her the life she's been dreaming of. He decides that he's going to delete his Tinder profile, since that was always the source of his problems with Soeurette. It was always too tempting to see so many blondes on Tinder. And now, with his Tinder profile deleted, he has nothing to distract him. He'll be able to focus all his attention on Soeurette. Unfortunately, a friend of Soeurette's tips her off that Matt has actually been the same boyfriend who's cheated on her the last 10 times. Soeurette is so confused as to how she could have been so stupid as to think that this was a different guy each time. Honestly, it's a little concerning that she could have been so naive to believe that a different man would have the same name, phone number, and social media profile as he does. It also makes you wonder what kind of life she's been living. \n\nBut what really pushes Soeurette over the edge is she finds out that Matt has been cheating on her with another one of her girlfriends, named Christelle.
