Obviously, it was turned into a museum, but you loved interacting with all of the local visitors.  \n\nOne day, you arrive at work to find a strange-looking letter in your mailbox.  You sort of recognize the envelope.  It's in French, but the color and the seal remind you of the Diplomatic Pouch that you have seen numerous times before.  \n\nThe letter isn't signed, but you can tell immediately that it's from the Etoile Noire, because that is written under the seal.  \"The Black Star?\" you think to yourself.  \"I've never heard of them\".\n\nThere is no return address, but the instructions on the package simply say that it is to be delivered to \"The United Nations\".\n\n\"This must be something about a new museum exhibit\" you think, since this is, obviously, the United Nations, in New York, where it always was before the war.  \n\nYou open up the package, and inside is a letter in French.  You've learned enough French in your life, and you have enough free time, that you are eventually able to translate it.\n\nIt isn't a museum exhibit at all.  All the events it refers to are taking place this year, in the present tense!  And it refers to world leaders that you have never heard of, but none of them represent the United States.\n\nWhat do you do?  This package was obviously meant to be delivered to a different United Nations, rather than the historical building in Old New York.  \n\nThere is no longer any internet, so you can't research any of the details, but you remember the old radio equipment in the museum.  \n\nYou find the most powerful radio available in the basement, and spend days scanning the airwaves.  Finally, after sifting through insipid American broadcasts, you hear a voice in French that mentions Etoile Noire.  The message then repeats itself in English, Russian, Arabic, and Spanish.\n\nWith all the work you've done, you are able to understand the message, even without the translations.  You know your French well enough to realize that this is the same broadcast that's included in the package.\n\nFrom the nervous and angry responses that come from the other radio users, you realize that the package wasn't from the Etoile Noire, it was about the Etoile Noire.\n\nThe Black Star is the United States!  \n\nThe more you listen, the more you realize that your parents' generation started World War III, and the rest of the world has only been able to recover by convincing Americans to remain in isolation!  \n\nYou wonder what you should do with this new information.  Do you wait until an official reply arrives from the Government of the United States?\n",
