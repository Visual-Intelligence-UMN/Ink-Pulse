The mastermind of the whole thing was a man named Johnathan Wright. He was an American but was living in the United Kingdom and chose that country as his base of operations. He has notified every single country on earth to not isolate, but did not tell the United States.\n\nDuring the first year of the United States isolation, Mr. Wright has made a press conference that aired globally (except the United States, of course) and he addressed the world saying, \"I want to address the world because I cannot stand by and allow this to happen, and I know a lot of you agree.\"\n\nSo in the end, Wright's prediction did actually come true. The United States did not turn into a dictatorship superpower ruler of the world, and the world got an excuse to rebuild and reorganize their governments in a way that would prevent something like this from happening again. There were significantly less wars, and more organizations were formed to ensure that global peace was maintained.\n\nThe world moved on and everyone actually had a pretty good time. The earth slowly healed and pollution rates went down significantly. Climate change was no longer a threat because most of the planet was cooled down to temperatures that were not harmful to human life. Researchers have gathered data and found out that the planet was returning to a time before man walked on Earth. This was all conveyed peacefully to President Fitzpatrick. \n\n\"If this is the way the world wants to go, so be it,\" He said reluctantly, admitting to the horrors and to the damages his country made in the past millennia's. He then made a declaration of his own and ordered the US military to stop all military action and focus on helping the world rebuild. He ordered to also get rid of all nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and to destroy any of them that were still in the hands of the US military.\n\nIt only took 50 years, and it may seem long to you, but \n",
