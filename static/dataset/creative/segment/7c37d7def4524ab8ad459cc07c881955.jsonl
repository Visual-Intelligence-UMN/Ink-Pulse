You can either believe the lies you've been told your entire life, or you can take a chance and do something you've never done before. You look at the bee and say, \"I'm not a king. Why are you calling me Your Majesty and asking me for my orders?\" The bee looks at you and says, \"Because you are my king. You are the king of all bees. You are the king of the hive.\" You are surprised by what the bee is saying. After all, if you're so allergic to bees how could it be possible for you to be king of the hive? You look at the bee and say, \"I don't believe you. I'm not the king of the hive. I'm not the king of all bees. I'm not the king of anything.\" The bee smiles. \"I know you don't believe me.

It gathers up hundreds of bees, all of them buzzing around you. The bee then flies back up to you and lands on your hand. \"Look,\" the bee says. \"I've gathered up all your disciples for you.\" You look at the bees and say, \"I don't have any disciples.\" But they merely buzz at your side. You look at the bee and say, \"I don't understand.\" The bee says, \"We are your personal hive and we are at your service for whatever you need.\" Finally, you start to get an idea for how the bees can be useful to you. You say, \"You know what, I have the perfect order for you.\" The bees all buzz in excitement. I say, \"Go to a girl named Soeurette's apartment and cover her in stings. Soeurette has always been rude to me and I would like to use this opportunity for payback!\" \n",
