The prosperity of the country was a source of envy for their rivals, but there were no wars or battles that involved Prestonia for it was a pacifist country. It did not involve itself in such ways with other countries, choosing instead to trade strategically primarily for the benefit of itself.\n\nThe people in Prestonia were known as the Prestonians and they lived comfortably in their country. That is, until many countries in the world had formed an agreement with one another to increase trade with one another, and to foster cooperation. Prestonia naturally declined, as it was a country built on self-sufficiency, and for it trade was a strategic means for it to grow and expand its influence. It would be the only country to decline the agreement, as the other countries of the world primarily thought it would benefit from more trade with one another. Prestonia was not willing to compromise its principles, in fact, it had decided to implement a period of isolation to prove to the other countries that it did not need their help to sustain itself. It had a desire to stand alone and prove to the world that it was capable of maintaining its own existence, a desire that was shared among the leaders of Prestonia and its many citizens. On March 1880, Prestonia entered a 10 year period of isolation.\n\nBecause of Prestonia's decision to isolate itself, the other countries were oddened by such a decision, and attempted to plea with the leaders of the country to reconsider. However, communications were not made nor established during the isolation, as Prestonia proved it was willing to take its isolation seriously. The world's countries were ultimately disappointed by the decision, but they acccepted Prestonia's wishes, hoping it would be able to handle its isolation as it claimed. The countries thus drew their attention elsewhere, to help each other, and to resolve the other issues found in the world.\n\n10 years later, during the year 1890, the countries of the world had tried to resestablish contact with the country of Prestonia. But they were met with silence. Thinking it had prolonged its isolation, the countries of the world sent a diplomatic envoy to discuss with the leaders of Prestonia the possibility of ending the isolation. The first thing the envoy discovered on their journey to Prestonia, were the ruins found in the mountains.\n",
