Earth then modified the design and sent a small group of special space forces to save him. \nThey entered the alien solar system undetected, made it to the star's corona with no problems and managed to grab Matt, drop a dark matter bomb and shoot back off undetected. This gave earth back its most liked person in the world but little did they know it was only a clone and one of millions now inhabiting the real alien home world.\n",
