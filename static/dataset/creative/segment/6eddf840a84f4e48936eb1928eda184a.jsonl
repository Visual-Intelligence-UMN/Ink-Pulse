I saw my first birthday and then before I knew it was in school meeting friends that would remain with me for the rest of my life. I saw my first kiss and my first heartbreak. I saw my graduation from high school and then from college. I was so caught up in the film that I nearly forgot how I got there. There was a break in the film around age 21 before things started to get a little crazy in my life and we all went to the lobby for intermission. \nThere I talked with some of my doubles to try and figure out what in the heck was going on. I was then handed a pamphlet. One of my doubles mentioned that I was the last one to enter and did not get one with the rest of us. I looked it over carefully and the clear objective of this experience was to live a life of an average american at the turn of the 21st century. I was in simulation the whole time learning what it was like to live in the past during such a transitional time in human history. This was actually just one of many simulations that you take part of in the future of education. I am now to reflect on my most previous life, learn what I can from so I can apply what I have learned in the future where I am originally from. \n",
