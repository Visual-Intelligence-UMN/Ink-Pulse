This is a story about the 92nd little pig.\n\nThe 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, \"dude.\" And the 92nd little pig was like, \"no, dude.\" The wolf asked the pig, \"Where did you get the depleted uranium from to build this house? I'm not going to eat you if you tell me.\" And the 92nd little pig said, \"I found it in the desert.\" And the wolf was like, \"dude, I'm not going to eat you if you tell me where in the desert you found it.\" And the 92nd little pig said, \"I found it in the desert near the nuclear testing grounds.\" The pig said, \"Just go 20 miles up north into the Frowling Mountain, climb to the top, and you'll see a big building that is the nuclear testing grounds. If you want access inside then you should make a costume to pretend that you're a pig.\"\n\nThe wolf said, \"I'm not going to eat you if you tell me what you mean by 'pig costume.'\" And the 92nd little pig said, \"I mean that you should make a costume to pretend that you're a pig.\" The wolf said, \"Oh OK, I see!\" Well, I'm going back home to make my pig costume and then I'll head up to the nuclear testing grounds in Frowling Mountain in a few days.\" \"Good luck!\" said the pig.\n\nA few days later the wolf did exactly as he said he was going to do and after he made his pig costume out of old pig skins that he shed off of some poor pigs that he killed, he headed up to the nuclear testing building at the top of Frowling Mountain. He took one day to get there and then a whole day to get to the top. Once he got to the top, he saw the nuclear testing grounds was so excited and relieved that it was really true. He went to what appeared to be the front door, knocked on the door, and then the door opened.\n\nHe thought that was kind of strange but didn't think too much of it and walked right in. He saw a bunch of pigs and a pig in a lab coat. His mouth was becoming so watery now because he was salivating at the thought of eating all of these pigs. Then a really big pig, the biggest one he's ever seen goes up to him and says, \"Welcome to the nuclear testing grounds.\n",

He then sat down in his recliner and said, \"I'll bluff, and bluff and blow you up!\" and the pig's troubles were over.\n",
