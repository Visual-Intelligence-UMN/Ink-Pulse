My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.\n\nMy neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.\n\nThe plan was simple. He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he did just that. The plan went off without a hitch and he went to bed, excited to see his new rank. \n\n\nHe woke up the next day, ready to see how well this plan went off.\n",
