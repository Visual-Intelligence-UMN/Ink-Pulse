Mana gathers it's strength from everyone collectively reaching towards the same goal, which is getting rid of the aliens. When the Earth was over populated, Mana struggled to survive because humans were always at odds with each other. Political battles, gender battles, income battles. All of the hatred humans had for one another, kept Mana silent and not of much use. Now that humans collectively are fighting to rid their world of the aliens, the power they hold is insurmountable. \n",
