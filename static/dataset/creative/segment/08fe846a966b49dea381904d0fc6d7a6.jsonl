Unmotivated + uneducated is not a good combination.\n\nI think that the United States should have been more prepared for the situation that they were in. During those 50 years, they should have been educating their people on how to handle the situation of no one else going in isolation. They should have been teaching them how to be productive and how to get things done. \n\nIn the future, the United States should not be so quick to go into isolation. They should take the time to educate their people on how to handle the situation of no one else going in isolation. That will help them avoid the future problems that they are going to have.\n",

        "text": "Following World War III, all the nations of the world agreed to 50 years of strict isolation from one another in order to prevent additional conflicts. 50 years later, the United States comes out of exile, only to learn that no one else went into isolation. That is really scary to think about. All of this time the United States could have been productive and got things done but 50 years were wasted because during isolation the United States grew unmotivated.\n\nThe United States has a very large population of people who are not educated as in they have no clue how to handle this situation of no one else going in isolation beside them. This is a problem that is not going to go away. Them not being educated really just puts a damper on the future of the United States.
