It turns out that the largest conspiracy ever had taken place and that those who had conspired where the all of the children that had given their fathers at one point a \"#1 Dad\" mug. They had resolved to input all of the information about their dads into a predetermined algorithm that would collate the dads by who was best. They then had resolved to replace the #1 Dad\" mugs at the same time. Thus, Task Force Papa One was dissolved having solved the mystery and each father knew how good of a father he really was. In the end, the children of the men posited that by knowing this information, all fathers would strive better to be better dads.\n",
