But that was nice. I wish I had done that when I was a child.\"\n\nJane thought hard, she felt like some thought was just out of reach. Something that was a part of her memory, but not. \"Wait, the same thing happened to you? Me too. I wonder if maybe, we are all more connected than you think.\"\n\nThe older woman frowned. \"But we are all so different, just look at us.\" \n\nJane looked at her, and thought about it. \"Yes, but that is the outside. And anyway, isn't the whole idea to grow and change, and learn? Maybe that is the point? To learn? About ourselves? What we can do or be better?\" \n\nJane was surprised to realize that she felt excited and alive again. She grabbed the older woman's hand. \"How about we watch the movie together, and see what else we can learn?\"\n",

        "text": "When you die, you appear in a cinema with a number of other people who look like you. You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen.\n\n\"Well,\" she thought \"This sucks.\"\n\nJane sat in front of a large screen, with a dozen other people around her. Various genders, colors, ages. She looked around at the other people as they all watched life play out on the screen. She had always disliked the movies anyway, and now she was stuck here, with a movie she had no control over. With \"herself\"? Nope. Not what she had been hoping for. \n\nAs the movie went on, Jane found herself not really watching. \"Whatever. Is this some kind of reward? Watching someone else who will claim to be you, doing things you can't control? Or is this some kind of punishment?\" Jane looked around, desperate for distraction. Another, older woman was sitting nearby. She saw Jane looking at her, and smiled. She decided to risk it. Was talking during a \"movie\" even bad manners in the afterlife anyway? \n\n\"Hi. How long have you been here?\" Jane whispered, still playing by the rules even in her frustration. \n\n\"Oh, I've been here for a long time.\" The older woman smiled. \"Longer than anyone else still here.\" \n\nJane focused on her, and that statement. \"What do you mean? How many of me have there been? More than this?\"  \n\n\"Oh yes. But I don't think even in all that time that I ever really though of any of them as 'me'.\" \n\n\"Why are you still here? It sounded like others were here, but now they are gone? Where?\" Jane asked, more loudly than she meant to.\n\nSome of the others turned to look at her. Most looked lost, but some looked contemplative. And one in particular looked almost...satisfied. \n\n\"Why are you so interested in them?\" The older woman asked, growing tense as she looked at the one, satisfied looking person. \"It's not like we are connected at all, other than being told we share a soul, which seems like nonsense to me given what I've seen on the screen!\" \n\nThe older woman seemed to be getting agitated, and as Jane split her attention between the screen, the older woman, and the satisfied looking person, something strange and amazing happened. She suddenly had a memory. Just like the young boy on the screen she had once broken a friend's toy and then tried to hide the evidence. But the boy on the screen then did something different - he changed his mind and confessed. The friend forgave him, and they both felt better. And suddenly the satisfied looking person (whom Jane had decided to call George) smiled, and just vanished. \n\nShe watched George's departure, and noticed that even the older woman looked relieved. \"Well, another one gone and I still don't know how they do it. But that was nice. I wish I had done that when I was a child.\"\n\nJane thought hard, she felt like some thought was just out of reach. Something that was a part of her memory, but not. \"Wait, the same thing happened to you? Me too. I wonder if maybe, we are all more connected than you think.\"\n\nThe older woman frowned. \"But we are all so different, just look at us.\" \n\nJane looked at her, and thought about it. \"Yes, but that is the outside. And anyway, isn't the whole idea to grow and change, and learn? Maybe that is the point? To learn? About ourselves? What we can do or be better?\" \n\nJane was surprised to realize that she felt excited and alive again. She grabbed the older woman's hand. \"How about we watch the movie together, and see what else we can learn? Together, as one\"\n\nThe older woman, relaxed, and moved closer to Jane. \"Yes, you know, that sounds nice. Nothing has sounded so nice r exciting for so long.\"\n\nAnd as the women watched the movie together, they talked. And shared, and learned. And as the movie came to an end they both looked quite satisfied, and vanished just as an old man appeared in the theater.\n",
