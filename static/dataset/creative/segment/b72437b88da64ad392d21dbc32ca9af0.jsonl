She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.\n\nOne day, the shapeshifter takes another form and falls for a new girl. He's decided that the girl he had pursued with so much vigor before, isn't worth his time, and he pours himself into a relationship with this new woman.   He's so consumed with his affection for this woman, he doesn't realize the girl he had originally dated, is now pursuing him as well. This confuses him,  she'd broken up with him time and time again, no matter what approach he tried, or what physical shape he took. Now that she's trying to get back with him, he doesn't know what to do. He loves the new woman in his life very much, but he'd put so much effort into trying to achieve a relationship with the prior girl,  that he has a hard time not responding to her advances. The new woman eventually finds out about this, but to his surprise she doesn't leave him. He's happy, but he's also confused as to why she hasn't run away after discovering this, and he asks her. 'It's a surprise,' she tells him. \n\nHe waits for her to elaborate, but she doesn't. She instead tells him that she wants to have a date with him this week, at a particular restaurant. He agrees, and spends the rest of the week preparing,  and finally the night of the date arrives. He arrives at the restaurant, and he's surprised to find his old flame waiting for him instead of his new one. He's more than a little confused.\n",

He has a moment of insight; this woman is also a shapeshifter, and she's been toying with him. 'What's the game, why are you doing this?' he asks.  She replies 'I have a thing about guys who can't make decisions easily, I can't stand them. It was a test, and you failed.' She changes shape one final time, then leaves the restaurant, and he never sees her again, in either of these forms, or any other.\n",
