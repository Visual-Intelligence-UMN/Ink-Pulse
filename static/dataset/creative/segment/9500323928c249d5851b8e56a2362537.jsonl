        "text": "When you're 28, science discovers a drug that stops all effects of aging, creating immortality. Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the \"Lost Generations\" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. There is still hope. Recently, a plant was discovered that has the powers to not only stop aging, but reverse it. The catch: it only grows in a remote rain forest. There are many people willing to risk their lives to go to the rain forest to get the plant. You want to do it, too.\n\nThe team sets off for the rain forest. Among them is a botanist that hopes to succeed at growing more of the magical plants. The team travels for weeks and many are lost to disease, animal attacks, and the elements. By the time they reach the plant, the team only has 3 people left. The leader, the botanist, and you. The chances of making it back alive are lower than ever. \n\nIf you find the plant, will you be able to get home? The team decides to continue on their mission. One beautiful morning, they finally reach their destination. The plants are growing wild! \"We should test it,\" the botanist says, \"before we harvest it all.\" The botanist gathers a sample of leaves and crushes them in a mortar and pestle. He mixes the contents in a test tube with water, and begins to shake it. He looks at the solution and says nothing. He removes the cap of the test tube and takes a sip of the mixture. In an instant, he begins to age rapidly. The remaining teammates gasp in horror. The leader runs to the botanist, who now looks like a frail, old man. \"What happened? What have you done?\" The botanist pulls the leader's face close to his and says, \"I'm sorry.  I think the map was upside down. We're in the wrong valley.\" \n\nSuddenly, the botanist begins to cough up blood. He takes his last breath, and then dies. The leader, now in a state of panic, runs to the nearest tree. He climbs it, and surveys the surrounding area. He drops his arms at his side. \"It's no use. There's no way out.\" He sat on the tree branch and began to pray. Suddenly, a small, purple plant grows from the ground. He reached down to pick it up, but before he could even touch it, it blossomed and the botanist came back to life. They were in the right valley after all. \n",
