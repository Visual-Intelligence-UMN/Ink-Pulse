These ranks are based on mana power, which has quickly become the most important attribute in human society. \n\nAfter the aliens attacked and nearly destroyed all of humanity, the small group of human survivors lived in secret locations scattered in dense remote regions in the world, away from the alien colonies which remained on the planet. The twins became the leaders of one particular location, and rumors spread to the other secret locations of the power of these \"Mana Blessed\" twins. \n\nJenn and Jonn consolidated the most powerful mana users from all the human bastions. They led the humans in a rebellion against the alien colonies. The aliens and their high technology were overwhelmed by the sheer power of this new generation of mana users. The aliens were driven back to their original, more fortified colonies. The human resistance was faced with a greater technological threat in these locations, which contained motherships and armies of drones ships. \n\nThe most critical battle was fought in the Atlantica region, which was the largest hub of alien colonization. Jonn fell in the battle, sacrificing himself with a powerful spell to wipe out the most powerful motherships on the planet. Jenn remained to lead the humans to exterminate the remaining aliens, and lead humanity to rebuild and flourish as they once did. \n",
