        "text": "Your entire life, you've been told you're deathly allergic to bees. You've always had people protecting you from them, be it your mother or a hired hand. Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\"\n\n\"I really need to get more sleep. These all nighters are starting to give me hallucinations.\" you think as you shoo the bee away and dodge into the next room. You head to your Mom's study, to let her know that a bee had gotten in the house somehow. You open the door and find her sitting at her desk, with a man in a suit sitting across from her.\n\nShe is quite pale, and doesn't look happy to see the man. \"I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't do that.\" she says in a strained voice. WHen she notices you, she tries to change her expression and tone. \"Hello dear. This is Mr. Tomas. We've worked together before, so he stopped in to visit on his way through town. But he really needs to be going now.\"\n\nYou look at the man, and he smiles at you. In the worst possible way.  \"Hello Dan. I've heard so much about you, and I've been looking forward to meeting you. I'm sure we'll be able to talk more another time.\"\n\nYou feel incredibly uneasy as he takes his leave, and your mother is still acting oddly as well. Suddenly, hearing a bee talk to you seems like a thing that might actually have happened. \n\n\"Mom, what was that all about?\" you ask. As she tries to wave it off, you decide it is time to tell her. \"Mom, I swear I heard a bee talk to me. And it called me \"You Majesty\". What does that mean? How is it even possible?\"\n\nShe looks at you, and you see a tear in her eye. \"Oh, oh dear. It's too late isn't it. But we still have a chance. Pack a bag immediately and let's go.\"\n\nYou are too shocked to do anything but what she tells you. The next thing you know you are flying down the highway and she is telling you a wild story of espionage, genetic engineering, government control, and secret societies. And somehow it all revolves around a bee cult from thousands of years ago.\" \n\n\"I don't know what to believe anymore.\" You are crying realizing your life as you knew it is over. But she smiles at you and says. \"It is a shame dear, I really liked this planet, but don't worry, we'll be safe soon.\" \n\nYou are still confused, but you know she is telling the truth. You come to a mountain, where she stops the car and makes some strange signs in the dirt. The next thing you know a huge..thing...spaceship?! is descending from the sky. A door opens, and you mother takes your hand, saying, \"It's time to go home dear.\" And so you do.\n",
