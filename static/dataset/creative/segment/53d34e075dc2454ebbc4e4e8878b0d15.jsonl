        "text": "All of the \"#1 Dad\" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly.\n\nBecause of this, you can no longer buy Father's Day Gifts in stores any longer, because the required inventory levels are too large.  You have to make your orders online.  \n\nYou head to Amazon, and when searching for a mug, the first result is: #1 Dad: Will Wright.\n\nYou think: \"Huh, Will Wright is a pretty cool name for a Dad\" you think to yourself.  It's also pretty common.  \"How do they know who to sell it to?\"\n\nYou look at the details, and it's a picture of your Dad!  With his wife, and kids!\n\nYou've never met these people before, but look at how happy they are!  \n\nYou stop and think for a minute.  Your dad was never around much when you were younger.  He was always away on business trips, but on the few times he was at home with you, he always seemed like he was in such a good mood.  You thought that his business trips were always really enjoyable.  Nevertheless, you loved the time you spent with him, even if he was always eager to get back to \"work\".\n\nYou think it over a bit longer, and eventually you make up your mind: \"Here's to a wonderful Father's Day,\" you think to yourself.\n\nYou decide you need to buy the mug for your Dad, but also a little something else.  \n\nYou do some Googling, and you find out where Will Wright lives with his family.    You read up about the address that you found, and discover that Will Wright is a valued member of his community.  \n\nYou finally figured it out!  The perfect Father's Day Gift!\n\nYou order the mug, and have it shipped to Will Wright's address, and along with the gift receipt, you also include a photo of the other thing you bought.  A round-trip airplane ticket to Will Wright's state.  \n\n\"Stay where you are, Dad\" you write in your note.  \"From now on, I'll come and visit you.\"\n\n\"He'll love it!\" you think to yourself, as you hit \"Send\"\n\nTHE END\n",
