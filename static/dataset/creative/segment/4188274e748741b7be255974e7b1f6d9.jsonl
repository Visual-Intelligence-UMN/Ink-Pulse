They had to use magic stones to hold the power of their mana so they could make sure  the shield always stayed up and did not have to channel it all day and night. \n\nSure enough, the aliens came back, but they could not get through the shield no matter how hard they tried, so the aliens set up a border around Earth to wait for the day the shield might fall so they could make their strike against the humans.\n\nThe human knew this so they had to prepare another weapon using their mana to get rid of the aliens once and for all. It really wasn't a weapon to fight though. It was a great spell of teleporting. So the humans gathered one day and channeled all their mana together, and teleported Earth to a far far away galaxy close to a new sun.\n\nThey did it, the humans won. They never saw the aliens again, and life returned to normal.\n\n",
