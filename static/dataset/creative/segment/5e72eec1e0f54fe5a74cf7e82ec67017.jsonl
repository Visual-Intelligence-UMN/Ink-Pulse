I tried washing the mug as I couldn't believe what I was seeing. \n\n\"World's #0 Dad,\" it said.\n\nI cried and cried. Tears won't stop and tears did not stop for hours. I was reminded that I no longer have my son. He died in a car accident a few years ago. It was my fault. He was angry at me that day and probably too angry to be driving. My last conversation with my son was about how I was a terrible father. I would never forget his last words, \"\n",
