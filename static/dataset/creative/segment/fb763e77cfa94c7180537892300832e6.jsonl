They are 'side effects' of government policy.\"\n\n\"What!\" \n\n\"Shhh\" she said. \"You must remain calm. We're can't take any risks right now.\" \n\n\"What are you talking about?\" you tried to remain calm, but judging by her face it was not a good performance. \n\n\"The side effects are the result of policy. Think about it, if everyone lives forever the planet can't sustain us all for long. So when the population reaches a certain point, they hold a lottery.\" She covered her mouth after she said it, as if there was a possibility one of the other patrons would hear.\n\nOh god, you suddenly understood. It was population control, and anyone who wasn't going to die naturally was a possible target. You suddenly thought about what a crime it was to have the government decide who lives and who dies.\n\n\"So, what do we do?\" you asked. \n\n\"Well, we're still trying to figure that out. But I have to warn you, you're not going to like what the most likely plan is.\" \n\n\"I'll do whatever it takes.\" you said without hesitation.\n\nShe looked at you with steely eyes. \"I am part of a group who foresaw this plan decades ago. We've been infiltrating the system at every level, every department, every related company. And we do have a plan. To be honest I lied just now, we know what has to be done. We don't need you, I just wanted to...warn you.\"\n\n\"What is the plan?\" \n\nShe looked at you. We are going to destroy the ability to create the drug, all current supplies, and all information related to the drug. It will no longer be available. Soon, and from now on, all humanity will live normal life spans, just like you and I will. Except for those who have already taken the drug.\"\n\n\"What about them?\" you weren't sure you could go along with the plan.\n\nShe looked somber. \"They will die eventually too, rather through accident, suicide, or just neglect. Unfortunately they will have to see many of their younger relatives and friends die. But it is necessary to avoid this dystopian future for all.\"\n\nYou had to admit it made sense. You hated it. But... your children and grandchildren didn't have the \"side effects\" yet; if this meant they could make their own choices in the future, it was worth it.\n\nYou went home and kept silent. You told no one of your conversation. And then one day the news came that the drug had been destroyed. Everyone was horrified, since the fact of the government's \"policy\" wasn't revealed. The conspirators decided that it was best faith in the government remained. It was necessary if they were to avoid a bloody revolution. \n\nEventually, using some clever social engineering, they were able to spread the idea that losing the drug and the \"side effects\" was for the best. People accepted it. And you took the secret to the grave, content with the hope for a better future.\n",
