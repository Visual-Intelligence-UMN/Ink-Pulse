Barack also remembers reading the same phrase in a super top secret cable from MI6. It stated that Ronald Regean and George H.W. Bush were seen netting with the head of the Chinese government and Taiwan.\nThis is what Barack found inside the letter. It said to call this number after taking care of any remaining, personal business. It also suggested that you say your goodbye's just in case. While that last part made Barack very hesitant, he decided it was in his and the nations best interest for him to follow through. He then calls, the phone is picked up by a secretary with a real loud, strong Boston accent and directed his call to the head of the Presidential Afterlife establishment. Barack enters the office and sees JFK but he is about 20 years younger then when he was president. He sits Mr. Obama down and fills him in. This department is the most highly secretive one in the world. When presidnets die they are cloned and have all their knowledge and experience transferred to the younger, immortal body. With the combined might of the last 9 presidents, we have a team that can defeat evil at every angle. We are what prevents the world from being destroyed on a weekly basis. The world is actually destroyed in one way or another 48 times a year on average and it is our job to stop it from happening using time travel, cloning and all the data we can harness. So far we have been successful. \n",
