        "text": "Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had one hundred little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.\n\nThe 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, \"dude.\"\n\n\n\nThe 92nd little pig's house was pretty much a giant death trap.  The only one who could live there was the 92nd pig.  Somehow, he had grown accustomed to the radiation that the depleted uranium was giving off.  It also caused some interesting side effects.   He was a very large pig.  Extremely large.  When the neighborhood wolf heard a little pig moved into the neighborhood, he thought the 92nd pig would be easy prey.\n\nThe wolf brought his best house warming gift, a basket of truffles, to the 92nd pigs house.  He thought he could get the 92nd pig to let his guard down for a meal of truffles.  The 92nd pig would in turn become the wolf's meal.  \n\nThe wolf knocked on the door of the 92nd pigs house.  He tried to compose himself, but all he could think about was eating the pig for dinner.  When the pig opened the door, the wolf suddenly lost his appetite.  He was shocked at the size of the pig.  The pig towered over the wolf.  The pig's hide seemed to be thick and impenetrable.  The wolf realized this was a mistake.  \n\n\nThe wolf tried to act normal, but the 92nd pig didn't buy it.  The wolf welcome the pig into the neighborhood and meekly gave him the basket of truffles.  Due to the strength of the pig, when he grabbed the basket of truffles, he almost pulled the wolf off of his feet.   The wolf knew then he had to make a quick exit.  \n\nThe wolf told the pig if he needed anything to just let him know.  The wolf then ran as fast as he could.   The 92nd pig smiled to himself when the wolf left.  \"Maybe living here will turn out to be pretty entertaining\", the pig said.\n",
