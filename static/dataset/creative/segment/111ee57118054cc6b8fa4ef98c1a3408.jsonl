Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations\" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.\n\nBy then, the world is almost entirely filled with bright-eyed, attractive, youthful young adults. People like you have to hide on the edges of society, avoiding their judgemental gazes at all costs as you become more and more decrepit and they remain strikingly beautiful.\n\nBecause of that, you don't even hear about the breakthrough discovery until weeks after it's become a global sensation. The first time you hear about it, you're in the middle of a crowd of young adults waiting to get into the grocery store.\n\nA girl in front of you in the line spots you and grabs you by the shoulders.\n\n\"You're one of the lucky ones,\" she weeps, nearly knocking you off your feet with her youthful strength. \"You're one of the Lost Generations, aren't you?\"\n\nIt's silly that she needs to ask, because it's obvious. But you nod anyways.\n\nHer tears fall faster. \"Please remember me,\" she sobs, flinging herself into your arms and squeezing your shoulders in a tight embrace. \"Remember all of us when we... when we...\"\n\nHer words choke to a halt, leaving you baffled and afraid.\n\nA young man approaches you and places his hand on her back. He also looks sad.\n\n\"We're sorry,\" he says to you. \"For all the times people like us... well. We didn't know, of course. And we never got the choice, did we? People like us... this is the end of the line, isn't it?\"\n\nYou don't know what to say. You have no idea what they're talking about. So you nod, hoping it might mean something to them.\n\nSniffling, the girl detaches from you and takes the young man's hand. \"Please remember us,\" she repeats, giving you one last mournful stare before stepping through the store door.\n\nAs the automated door shuts behind her, you realize it's covered in a large poster, marked with the seal of the government. It's a warning about the side effects of the immortality drug.\n\nYou read the poster, and the world falls out from under you.\n",
