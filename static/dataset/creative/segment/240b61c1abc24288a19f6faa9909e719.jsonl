It was located far underground, it appeared to be just chance that the orb was found directly next to last remaining humans, far underground. One of the young boys ran over to pick it up before he could be told not to and immediately his body started glowing blue. Everyone stepped back in awe and shock. The boy then said \"water\" and water started to pool up in an empty well next to him. He then sprayed some of the kids as a joke. Then the kids started glowing in different colors. All the prime colors and a few others that were not very familiar were also part of the group. The kids started producing food, drinks, entertainment and all kinds of other spoils that they had done with out for so long. \nThe military leaders made their way in a this point, was brought up to speed and said this maybe just what we need to get drive off the hostile aliens and retake our planet. Over the course of a couple months, the mana was studied, harnessed and even improved on. It was time to take our planet back yelled the military commander to cheers from the crowd. \nThe humans were able to conjure up energy and matter at will and were able to use their creativity to ultimately defeat the alien invaders and within a year, had rid the world of all hostile aliens. A few alien defectors stayed behind. Over the course of a couple hundred years the world was rebuild better using the power of mana and human creativity.\n\n\n\n",
