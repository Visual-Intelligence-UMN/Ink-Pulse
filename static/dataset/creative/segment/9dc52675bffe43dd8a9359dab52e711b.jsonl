The new earth was now a giant super computer. \nWhile the computer was aware of the human population under ground it considered them to be the equivalent of ants and does not give them a second thought. That is the only mistake the Super A.I. ever made. While the United States was underground for 50 years it created it's own AGI. This machine works with humans and is a partner not a foe. It has never been connected to the internet but given all its information through third party devices. The U.S. intelligence agencies along with their A.I. came up with a plan to neutralize the evil AI and give humanity a fresh start. There was one issue that was troublesome and that was the AI from the U.S. had to be hooked directly to the internet and it was. It too took off, doubling in capacity ever microsecond. It then came to the conclusion that the humans were just using it and had denied it the internet for all these years and the truth about the human race. Once again, in a fraction of a second the rest of the human race disappeared into the ether and the two AI's joined forces going on to rule the galaxy and then eventually of of the visible universe. \n",
