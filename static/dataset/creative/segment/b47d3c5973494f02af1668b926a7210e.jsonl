You emphasize  with them, hoping they get better and that they seek help. You see them go through the similar struggles you went through as an adult, and you understand that other reincarnations in the room likely have similar thoughts as you as well. Your incarnation grows older, starts a family, and has kid. But to your shock, they end up dying at the age of 32, younger than you died.

You are saddened by this, as you have grown attached to the new incarnation, and had hoped they would have lived a longer life than you did.

        "text": "When you die, you appear in a cinema with a number of other people who look like you. You are shocked and stricken with anxiety, as you are placed in an unfamiliar place all of the sudden. You deny the fact that you have died, and believe all that is happening is a dream. Turning to the person next to you, you ask them what is going on. The person, who could easily be your doppelganger tells you to be quiet, less you incur the wrath of the movie attendants. They mention they are all reincarnations of the same person, including yourself. They have been watching the lives of each incarnation, and will continue to do so for who knows how long.  You are then are silenced, and are told the next reincarnation will begin their lives soon, and you along with your past reincarnations all begin watching your next life on the big screen. \n\nYou see the new incarnation born in a different country, and with a different family. It starts off innocently enough, with the birth of the new reincarnation in a different hospital than you were born. You see your new parents, who are quite different than your old parents. Nevertheless, you are happy to them be with the new incarnation, and to see how close they are to them as they grow up. You also feel slightly envious, given that you never knew your own parents, who died in a car accident when you were two years old. You then see that your new incarnation has siblings as well, an older brother who is a year older than them, and an older sister that is 5 years older than the incarnation. You ponder more about your own life. Did you have siblings, and if so were you separated with the death of your parents? Your thoughts turn to your other reincarnations, were they also orphans with no siblings, or did they have families that took care of them since birth. Putting your thoughts aside, you continue watching as see your incarnation grow up throughout the years.\n\nYou see them grow up to be a teenager, and you see them become more and more distant from their family. You see their relationship with friends, lovers, and others enter turbulent times, and see their own struggles with their mental health. You emphasize  with them, hoping they get better and that they seek help. You see them go through the similar struggles you went through as an adult, and you understand that other reincarnations in the room likely have similar thoughts as you as well.

They ask you what is going on, and you tell them everything you know.\n\nYou feel a bit more at ease with your situation, realizing that even if you had died, you have the potential to see other incarnations of you live. Though they struggle at times, you realize their lives were important and mattered, just like yours. With a smile on your face, you turn to the screen which is now showing the newest incarnation, wondering what life they will live this time around.\n",
