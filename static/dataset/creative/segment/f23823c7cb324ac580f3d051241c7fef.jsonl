If the mug was true, then there would be many #1 Dads living in the world today. For some, they would wonder who would be in fact the # 1 Dad, could such a thing be measured? The answer was found one day to be yes, and was apparently not a difficult thing to do.\n\nFor one day, all the #1 Dad mugs in the world changed to reflect the true ranking of the owner of the mug. That is, the dads in the world finally learned how they rank in comparison to the others who had the same kind of mug. It was a shock to many, and the results were not what they expected. Many were disappointed to learn they ranked so high, expecting to be ranked lower to gloat they were better dads than their friends. Many posted on social media their rankings, which eventually caused groups of interested parties to collect the rankings and the names of the dad to make an official public list. The list spanned almost 10 million in total, and was an interesting read to say the least. The list did not appear to show what made one dad better than the other, but that didn't stop people from speculating. However, the most crucial part of the list would be the top 10, that is the 10 dads in the world that were the best of the best.\n\nThe top 10 were an unusual bunch. They didn't seem to gloat to much about their rank, in fact they were certain it was a mistake and they should be ranked lower. Other dads would agree with them, mentioning they were undeserving on their rank. However, the list was final, and the top 10 were the best of the best. Nothing the other dads could do would change that. Or so many believed. \n\nOne day, the top 10 dads were invited to a special meeting. They were to receive a special banquet, to celebrate their achievement and for many to hear from them about their lives, so they too can learn how to be potentially better fathers like them. The day of the banquet was struck with tragedy. The top 10 dads were all found dead, their bodies scattered all over the banquet hall. Although those responsible were never found, it was presumed to be other fathers at fault for their deaths, having poisoned the food of the banquet to eliminate the top 10 dads i the world. They were never caught, as there was no evidence to be found at the crime scene, nor anyone to admit to their crimes.\n\nThe next day, as people expected the mugs to change to reflect that the top 10 had died, the mugs were indeed found to change once again. This time, the mugs were blank, no longer showing the rank of the dads of the world, nor any lettering of any kind. The mugs were now blank, and would remain that way forever.\n",
