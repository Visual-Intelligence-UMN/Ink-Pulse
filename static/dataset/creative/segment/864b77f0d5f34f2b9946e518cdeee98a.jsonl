The woman behind the counter looks at you. You stare back. A second passes, then another.\n\n\"Codeine Linctus!\" you repeat, louder. The woman reaches for a small brown bottle and puts it into a small white paper bag, which she then hands to you. You then walk out of the chemist's shop. You step into a public restroom in the subway. You take the bottle of codeine and lift it up to your mouth. Two swallows, and it is gone.\n\nYou walk out of the subway and into a shopping centre. A small warmth rises in your chest and you notice that you feel calm and energetic.\n\nAnother chemist. Another bottle. Another swallow. The liquid is gone.\n",
