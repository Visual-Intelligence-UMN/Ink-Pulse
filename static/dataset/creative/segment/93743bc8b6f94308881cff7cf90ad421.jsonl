This is a story about the 92nd little pig.\n\nThe 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, \"dude, where did you get the uranium?\". And the 92nd little pig was like, \"I mined it out of the ground\". \n\n\"How did you do that?\" \n\n\"With a shovel\" said the pig.\n\nAnd the wolf was like, \"that's pretty cool and all but I really meant how did you mine it from the ground?\"\n\n\"It mined itself. Its self-mining depleted uranium\" said the pig.\n\nAnd the wolf was like, \"that is so cool!\"\n\nAnd the wolf was like, \"can I come in and see it?\"\n\nAnd the pig was like, \"sure\" and he let the wolf in.\n\nThe wolf advanced toward the pig. \"I'd stop if I were you,\" said the pig, and reached for a nearby wand. Holding the wand near his belly a loud clicking filled the room.\n\n\"What’s that?\" asked the wolf. \"A Geiger counter\" said the pig. \"If you eat me you will get radiation sickness and die.\"\n\n\"Oh\" said the wolf, \"that sucks, I was really looking forward to eating you.\"\n\n\"I know you were\", said the pig, and hit the wolf over the head with the Geiger counter. The wolf collapsed.\n\nAnd the pig was like, \"good riddance\". He then stuffed the wolf into the over and set it on \"bake.\"\n\nWhen the wolf was fully cooked the pig ate him. \n\nThat is how the 92nd little pig got his groove back.\n\nThe end.\n",
