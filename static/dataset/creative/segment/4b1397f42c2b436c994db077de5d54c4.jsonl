Undoubtedly, they would not be considered a superpower anymore because they had nothing to do with any conflicts in the past 50 years. They were now considered a middle country like Canada and Cuba. \n\nWith a new ally in Canada, the US was ready to explore the new world and the new global political landscape. Hopefully they will be able to stay out of any conflicts, as tensions were high. With Canada by their side, the US felt confident that they can find their way in this brave new world. \n",
