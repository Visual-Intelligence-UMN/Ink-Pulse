        "text": "When you're 28, science discovers a drug that stops all effects of aging, creating immortality. Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the \"Lost Generations\" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. The serum causes delayed neurodegenerative brain damage, and the majority of humanity, while not aging, are getting less intelligent, and less capable of maintaining civilization. They're also becoming increasingly violent and erratic. By the time this has occurred, most of the \"Lost Generations\" have died, and you are one of the younger members. It's up to you, and your elderly fellow survivors, to solve the problem before humanity is completely wiped out.\n\nA few of your group are scientists. They've managed to reverse-engineer the serum. They hope to create a variant of it that can not stop aging, but actually reverse it, allowing the elderly to regain their youth and vigor. The rest of you are responsible for keeping them safe until the drug has been perfected. The battle is uneven, you're outnumbered, and also inferior in terms of strength and stamina. You're forced to use your wits to defeat the increasingly monstrous attackers. You're aided by the fact that the majority of the population has become too degenerate to use weapons and technology, and also by the fact that they're deteriorating mentally, so they're unable to coordinate attacks.\n\nThe battle wages, and the progress on the serum escalates, but you're getting closer and closer to being overrun. The attacker's numbers are too much, and you're too weak, and many of you have already died.
