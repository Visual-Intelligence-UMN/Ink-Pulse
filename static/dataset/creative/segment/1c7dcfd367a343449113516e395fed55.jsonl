You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen.\n\nYou are seated at the head of a table in a crowded conference room. A man is speaking to you. He is a film director, and he has a movie he wants to make. He says he wants to make a movie of your next life.\n\n\"Just wait a minute,\" you say, \"I am watching your movie right now.\"\n\n\"That's because must have agreed to make it and you are watching the result,\" he says.\n\n\"I don't remember agreeing to make a movie of my next life,\" you say. \"Of course not,\" replied the man, \" that is not how these things work.\"\n\n\"How do they work?\" you ask.\n\n\"Your brain is erased between lives,\" says the man. \"Therefore, you don't remember making the movie.\"\n\n\"But this is supposed to be my future, not my past,\" you say.\n\n\"It is your future,\" says the man, \"but it is also your past.\"\n\n\"How can that be?,\" you reply.\n\n\"It is a paradox,\" says the man.\n\n\"Paradox?
