        "text": "All of the \"#1 Dad\" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly.\n\nThe \"Dad\" mugs are replaced with \"Dad\" mugs that are actually the correct ranking of Dads.\n\nIt's quite a shock to dads around the world.  Some of them already knew they were terrible dads.  But most of them thought they were better than the ranking that they were assigned.  I was away at college when I heard about what happened.  I found myself in chemistry class with my professor sipping from a mug that said #1,795,434,438 Dad.  I could probably have guessed that, given how he treated his students.  I found myself wondering if he didn't know what the mug said, or if he just didn't care.  If that were my ranking, I'd toss that mug.  I certainly wouldn't feel any pride in that number.\n\nAll over campus I saw professors with mugs of varying numbers.  I think the best I saw was 82,347,338.  That was for my economics professor, who I liked okay.  I found myself thinking almost constantly about where my dad must be ranked.  I thought he was a good dad.  He'd always provided for the family.  He rarely missed a Little League game and he helped with homework.  The more I thought about it, the less I could find wrong with my dad.  Sure, he worked a little too much, but he was always present and attentive when he was with me.  He taught me to ride a bike.  He taught me to shave.  He was kind to my dates, even if I knew he really didn't care for them.  My home was always a refuge for my friends who liked my dad as much as I did.\n\nI found myself thinking about how much I loved my dad.  I wanted to know his ranking, it was starting to pop up in my head unexpectedly.  But I didn't want to ask him.  I didn't want to make a big deal out of it in case it was a low number.  I didn't want to make him feel bad.  So I decided to wait until the holidays when I went home.\n\nThe last day of school was finally here.  I loaded my car and drove three hours to my parent's home.  When I got there, I hugged my parents.  They were so glad to see me, and we spent the evening chatting and catching up.  I got up early the next morning before anyone else was up.  I was so curious, I started going through the cabinets looking for my dad's #1 Dad mug.  I know he had one; I had gotten it for him when I was 5 or 6.  But I couldn't find it anywhere.  I searched the kitchen, the living room, the dining room, and the basement.  I didn't realize that someone was in the room with me as I was searching through the hall closet.\n\n\"Son,\" I heard my mom say.  \"Can I help you find something?\"\n\nI turned around, looking guilty.  \"Umm, I was just looking for something,\" I said.\n\n\"You're looking for your dad's #1 Dad mug, aren't you?\" she asked?  \"There's been so much made of that.  I'm glad your father's got broken a couple of years ago.  Ridiculous.  Like anyone could rate dads!  Sure, you can categorize them, but put them in order?  There's definitely not one number one dad. All that matters is how YOU feel about your dad, not a number\"\n\nI was relieved. My mom put into words what I had been thinking. It didn't matter if my dad was ranked number 1 or number 50 or number 2, 987,334.  He was my dad and I loved him, and he would always be number one to me no matter what a mug said.\n",
