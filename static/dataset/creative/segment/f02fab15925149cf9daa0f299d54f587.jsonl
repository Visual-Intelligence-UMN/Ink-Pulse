Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\" You look down and see a bee in a suit and tie. \n\n\"Little bee, please don't sting me,\" I said. \"I'm allergic and I will swell like a balloon if you do.\" \n\n\"I'm not going to sting you, Your Majesty,\" the bee said. \"Well then tell me, what do you want?\", I asked the bee. \n\n\"I'm here to help you with your duties as a queen,\" the bee said. So as it turned out, this bee and all of his friends had decided to make me their queen. They said I was the only one who could save them from the evil queen who was trying to take over the hive. Since this bee was nice and didn't sting me, I was eager to help. I agreed to be their queen. I had quite the task of finding this evil queen so that I could destroy her. I had to go through a lot of obstacles to get to her, but I was determined to save my hive. My first obstacle was a giant spider web.  I used a stick and I got the spider web out of the way of the hive. My second obstacle was a giant bear. Apparently he wanted the honey made by the bees and didn't want to hurt me. I told the bear I was just after the evil queen and I wouldn't take any of the honey so he let me go. I told the bear if he would help me, I bet the bees would give him some honey and the little bee in the suit agreed. So the bear agreed to help me catch the evil queen. \n",
