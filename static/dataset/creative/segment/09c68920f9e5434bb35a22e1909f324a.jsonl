You're just chilling at the kitchen table one day when you take a look at the mug that your daughter Harper gifted you for Father's Day one year when you discover the odd change. Over a breakfast of waffles, scrambled eggs, sunny side up eggs, pancakes, French toast sticks, and a side of bacon, you're wondering what happened to all the mugs. You ponder the question over some strawberries with powdered sugar and a dollop of whipped cream and think about it. As you chew, you look for your name on the ranking. After all, you've always been curious about the kind of dad you are. When you find it, you're somewhere in the bottom third. You shrug it off as a fluke and go back to your meal. \n\nBut then you notice that your name is no longer on the mug. In its place is the name of a different man. You look at the other mugs and find that your name is removed from all of them. At that moment, a cold chill runs up your spine. You get up from the table and try to call your wife, but she doesn't answer. Who is this guy whose name now replaces yours? The name is Mark Anders. You've never heard of him. He's definitely not a friend of yours. You run through your memory to see if you've forgotten someone. No, you don't know him. You go to your daughter Harper's room and find it empty. You start to panic.\n",

You get up from the table and try to call your wife, but she doesn't answer. Who is this guy whose name now replaces yours? The name is Mark Anders. You've never heard of him. He's definitely not a friend of yours. You run through your memory to see if you've forgotten someone. No, you don't know him. You go to your daughter Harper's room and find it empty. You start to panic. Where is she? \n\nWhen you call out for her, a man answers. It's Mark. He is Harper's new stepfather and you've never met him. You are genuinely confused. What happened to your wife, Soeurette? Mark tells you that Soeurette has been cheating on you for the last four years. You are shocked. He tells you Soeurette has been unhappy with your poor parenting skills and that this morning, she finally decided to marry Mark at a shotgun wedding place. You can't believe it. Mark earnestly tells you that he's come to love Harper over the years and has legally adopted her. \n\nYou are heartbroken. How could Soeurette do this to you? You think back to all the times she said, \"Our daughter is the only thing we have in common.\n",

You're just chilling at the kitchen table one day when you take a look at the mug that your daughter Harper gifted you for Father's Day one year when you discover the odd change. Over a breakfast of waffles, scrambled eggs, sunny side up eggs, pancakes, French toast sticks, and a side of bacon, you're wondering what happened to all the mugs. You ponder the question over some strawberries with powdered sugar and a dollop of whipped cream and think about it. As you chew, you look for your name on the ranking. After all, you've always been curious about the kind of dad you are. When you find it, you're somewhere in the bottom third. You shrug it off as a fluke and go back to your meal. \n\nBut then you notice that your name is no longer on the mug. In its place is the name of a different man. You look at the other mugs and find that your name is removed from all of them. At that moment, a cold chill runs up your spine.

Now you decide to get payback on Soeurette. You tell Mark Anders that Harper's college tuition and private school costs will amount to close to a million dollars. You tell Mark that since you are no longer legally Harper's father you will not have any role in paying that money. Mark is stunned because he doesn't have a good or steady job, and Lord knows Soeurette is a housewife and trophy wife. You leave, smirking, and let Mark consider the mess he has made. \n",
