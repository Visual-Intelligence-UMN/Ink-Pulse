Watashi thinks about this for a brief moment and then agrees to the deal. Himari embraces Watashi and disappears. Watashi is elated about his new powers and begins to practice how he can use the magic. Watashi decides to give himself one million dollars and a huge home on a mountain top. Watashi chants the spell and a large sum of money materializes on the kitchen table. He then realizes that he is actually now in a mansion on a mountain top in a place he does not recognize. Watashi is then shocked and confused on how he can be in such a place. He is scared because he does not know where he is and he wants to return back to familiar surroundings. Himari appears in his home and tells him that he will never return to the world of the living. Himari explains that the deal that they made is for eternity. He is now trapped in the world of magic and it cannot be undone. He now has the ability of magic and because of his greediness for power, he will never be able to return back to his world.\n",
