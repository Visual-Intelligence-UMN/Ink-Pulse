The peace in the world was contagious and soon the Americans got over being left behind and wanted to be a part of this new peaceful technologically advanced world. World peace was established for all. And the new technology didn't require the burning of fossils to the environment and humanity was saved! It's a sad thing that the United States had to get out of the way for this to happen but it did and everyone lived in peace on Earth from then on. The end. \n",
