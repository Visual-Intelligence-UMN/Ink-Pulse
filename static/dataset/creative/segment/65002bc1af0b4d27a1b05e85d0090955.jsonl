We were attacked by the Confederation over there, even though we were not supporting or supported by the USA at the time\"\n\nAnd from there the discussion went downhill. Suddenly insults were flying, and red phones were being called. Before the US President could even make his case to the UN,  WW IV was in full swing. But with modern technology, it was a short conflict. The US, in a bid to show that they were not the monsters they were made out to be, had released all their nuclear weapons before the war. Which meant they were no longer primary targets. But the other nations... Within 2 weeks the world was in ruin again. With the US relatively unscathed, despite being hated, and never firing a shot in offense or defense. \n\nThe US President met with his council again, and this time a very different mood permeated the room. \"Gentlemen, it is clear that the US is the current world power. Let us take this opportunity to guide the world again, and support them, while maintaining our position....\"\n\nAnd so the world went on, as it ever had.\n",
