This is a story about the 92nd little pig.\n\nThe 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, \"dude.\" And the pig was like \"That's right, dude. I saw the shaped charges you used on the 91st pig's steel reinforced concrete house, and that's not gonna cut it with mine.\" The wolf was like, \"Whatever, dude. I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there.\" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.\n\nMeanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, \"What if the wolf hadn't given up?\" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.\n\nHe told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.\n\nHe left his depleted uranium home, and ventured out to the forest, where \n",
