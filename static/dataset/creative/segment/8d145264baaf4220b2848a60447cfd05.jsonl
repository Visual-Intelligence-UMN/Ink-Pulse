The wolf strolled over, very happy with himself, scooped up the roasted pig and took him home to eat. The pig was better then expected. It had a taste unlike anything the wolf had ever tried before. There was one thing the wolf missed in 9th grade science and that was what is exposed to radioactivity becomes radio active itself. The wolf died an excruciating death over the next 5 days but he held on to the taste of his last meal, know that in the end it was worth it.\n",
