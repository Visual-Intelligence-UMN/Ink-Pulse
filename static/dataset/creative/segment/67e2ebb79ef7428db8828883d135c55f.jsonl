        "text": "An alien has kidnapped Matt Damon, not knowing what lengths humanity goes through to retrieve him whenever he goes missing. The aliens don't know what they stand to lose if they hurt the star of \"The Martian.\" After all, it was that movie, and Matt Damon's sublime performance, that lead to the cooperative space program. And it was that program that lead humans to Mars, and then to the discovery of interstellar travel. \n\nSo yeah, I think humanity would go to extreme lengths to get Matt Damon back. In other circumstances humans might have tried to contact the aliens first. But they were so worried about Matt Damon that they didn't have time for diplomacy. Instead, the set up a blockade in space. And immediately unleashed the greatest weapon. Blaring the song \"SOS\" by Abba as loud as possible.\n\nThe aliens were very upset by this. They couldn't stand Abba, and were sure this was the last straw. The lyrics may have been in English, but a frightening number of the words were similar to terrible insults in the aliens' language. They couldn't stand listening to this. All they had wanted was to bring Matt Damon to their home planet to run just a few experiments on him. He would have been fine, mostly, after. And it would have been fun for the aliens.\n\nBut this music and all of the human ships in their way were not fun. They decided to launch something on the humans that was slightly less entertaining than Matt Damon. They jut happened to have brought several plants of the most foul smelling species in the universe with them. But as they prepared to launch them at the Earth, they discovered that Matt Damon had already escaped. He actually called them on one of their shuttle communicators. \"So, uh, hey guys. This all kind of sucked. So I rewired my cell and escape. Oh, and I, uh, sabotaged your engines and weapons too. So you should probably just surrender.\"\n\nAnd with that the shuttle sped of to the Earth where Matt Damon was welcomed home by billions. Then the aliens were forced to surrender. They were pretty upset, but pinky swore never to kidnap another human ever again. \n",
