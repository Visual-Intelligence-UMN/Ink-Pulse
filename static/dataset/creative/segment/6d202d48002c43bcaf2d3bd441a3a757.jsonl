        "text": "Humans once wielded formidable magical power. But with over 7 billion of us on the planet now, Mana has spread far too thinly to have any effect. When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again.\n\nHumans had been researching and experimenting with mana since long before the invasion. Always looking for ways to harness the power, but all the attempts back then had failed.\n\nNow, with the aliens on the brink of victory, the last hope for humanity is to try again. The adults still seemed weak - the best they could manage were small things - lighting fires, creating small bursts of ice and the like. Occasionally useful for escaping the aliens, but not good enough to be weapons against their tech.  \n\nThe children, however, seemed to be far more powerful. No one was sure why, though there were many theories. But, to be blunt, there was no time for testing theories or even questioning the facts. Children could use mana better, and were stronger, and that was going to have to be enough. \n\nThe children were trained to use their magic, and they were trained hard. Captain Duran didn't like it much. \"Commander, we don't even know how to train these kids. They are experimenting with it as best they can and growing far stronger far faster than we could have imagined. But we don't know what the consequences will be.\"\n\nCommander Goran didn't like it much either. But. \"I agree. But I also know that we will be wiped out, children and all, within 5 years at best if this doesn't work. We are out of options. Proceed with the plan, and bring the children to the attack point in 30 days.\"\n\nThe plan was simple. The aliens' one weakness was that they were all linked to each other. And specifically they were all connected to what seemed like a literal mother ship. They protected it, shielded it, and guarded it with far more resources than was necessary. Even at the beginning, when humans were at their strongest they couldn't get close. It had to be the key. Destroy the ship and the aliens would be crippled. \n\nAt least that was what Commander Goran was counting on, praying for, begging to be true. And so they brought every child who could control mana at all as close as they could get. And the assault began.  \n\nAt the end of the day the Commander wasn't sure if it had gone well or not. The children attacked, and it seemed that the aliens realized the danger. Suddenly, using what was apparently transporter technology all of the aliens on the planet returned to the ship and boarded, some falling to the children's power as they went. And then the ship just...left. It took off and returned to space as far as anyone could tell.\n\nAs he frowned at the sky , Commander Goran was not sure if he should be relieved or not. Then a small girl approached him, with a strange blue light in her eyes, and an unnerving smile. \"Don't worry, we'll be here and ready for them when they come back.\" The Commander looked over at the children who had all grouped together, separate from the adults. They all had a strange glow, and a sense of power radiated from them. It felt almost inhuman. Almost...alien.\n",
