When the U.S. had got into exile, it had been the leading superpower of the world, but now, coming out, it is a third-rate power, and the world is dominated by the Soviet Union and China. The citizens of the U.S. are shocked to learn that the U.S. is no longer the most powerful nation in the world. In fact, the U.S. is now the laughingstock of the world. \n\nThe U.S. government decides to launch a preemptive strike against the Soviet Union and China in order to reestablish the U.S. as the dominant superpower. The U.S. launches an attack on the Soviet Union, but the Soviets are prepared for the attack, and the U.S. is forced to retreat. The U.S. then launches a nuclear attack on China. The Chinese retaliate by launching a nuclear attack on the U.S. The U.S. is devastated by the attack, and the U.S. government is forced to relocate to the underground bunker in Mount Weather, Virginia. \n\nThe Soviets and the Chinese then launch a full-scale invasion of the U.S. The Soviets and the Chinese are able to conquer the U.S. with relative ease, and the U.S. is divided into three parts: the Soviet Union takes the East Coast, China takes the West Coast, and the Rocky Mountains are left as a buffer zone.

John is a man who is willing to do anything to protect his family, and he is willing to fight for his country, even if it means going to war. So John hatches a plan to fight back against the Soviets and the Chinese. He knows he needs to do so covertly, because if he is caught, he will be executed. \n\nJohn's plan is to form a resistance movement against the Soviets and the Chinese.

He is able to recruit a man named Stuart, who is a former member of the U.S. military, and a man named Charlie, who is a former member of the U.S. Air Force.

In fact, the U.S. is now the laughingstock of the world. \n\nThe U.S. government decides to launch a preemptive strike against the Soviet Union and China in order to reestablish the U.S. as the dominant superpower. The U.S. launches an attack on the Soviet Union, but the Soviets are prepared for the attack, and the U.S. is forced to retreat. The U.S. then launches a nuclear attack on China. The Chinese retaliate by launching a nuclear attack on the U.S. The U.S. is devastated by the attack, and the U.S. government is forced to relocate to the underground bunker in Mount Weather, Virginia. \n\nThe Soviets and the Chinese then launch a full-scale invasion of the U.S. The Soviets and the Chinese are able to conquer the U.S. with relative ease, and the U.S. is divided into three parts: the Soviet Union takes the East Coast, China takes the West Coast, and the Rocky Mountains are left as a buffer zone. It's a surprising turn of events for U.S. citizens, who never once in their lives could have imagined that the U.S. would be conquered by another nation, let alone by two! \n\nOne man named John Matherson is a resident of the town of Black Mountain, North Carolina. He is a farmer and a widower, and he has two children: a son named Jacob and a daughter named Rachel. John is a man who is willing to do anything to protect his family, and he is willing to fight for his country, even if it means going to war. So John hatches a plan to fight back against the Soviets and the Chinese. He knows he needs to do so covertly, because if he is caught, he will be executed. \n\nJohn's plan is to form a resistance movement against the Soviets and the Chinese. He is able to recruit a few people to join him, including his son Jacob, his daughter Rachel, and a man named Tom. John's plan is to use his knowledge of the land to his advantage. He knows that the Soviets and the Chinese have no knowledge of the land, and he knows that he can use that to his advantage. He also knows that he needs to recruit more people to join his movement, and that he needs to do so quickly. So John and his group of freedom fighters set out to recruit more people to join their cause. \n\nJohn's plan works, and he is able to recruit more people to join his movement. He is able to recruit a man named Stuart, who is a former member of the U.S. military, and a man named Charlie, who is a former member of the U.S. Air Force. This is the perfect group of people since Stuart and Charlie have extensive vet experience. Now that John has assembled his team, he is able to begin his plan of action. \n\nJohn's plan is to attack the Chinese and the Soviets from the inside. He and his team will go into the Rocky Mountains and set up a base of operations there. From there, they will be able to launch attacks against the Soviets and the Chinese. It's really the ideal setup, because the Soviets and the Chinese are completely unaware of the fact that there is a resistance movement against them. When it's time to put the plan into action, John and his team begin to make their way to the Rocky Mountains. \n\nJohn and his team are able to make it to the Rocky Mountains without being detected by the Soviets or the Chinese. There, they set up a base of operations, and they begin to launch attacks against the Soviets and the Chinese. They are able to do so with relative ease, and they are able to do so without being detected. \n\nJohn and his team are able to launch a number of successful attacks against the Soviets and the Chinese. They are able to destroy a number of Soviet and Chinese supply depots, and they are able to destroy a number of Chinese and Soviet supply trains. The Chinese and Soviets are not able to figure out who is attacking them, and they are not able to figure out where the attacks are coming from. So slowly, the Chinese and Soviets' power is eroding, all thanks to John and his team. \n\nSoon, John and his team are able to launch an attack against the Soviets and the Chinese that will be their most daring yet. They are able to destroy a Soviet and Chinese military base, and they are able to destroy a Soviet and Chinese military convoy. The Soviets and the Chinese are now in a state of panic, and they are now in a state of confusion. With these wins for John and his team, \n",
