She meets him again, after he follows her to a bar. He is charming. The process starts again. She's dating him again.\n\nHe comes over to her house for dinner one night. She has everything prepared very nicely. They enjoy their dinner. She asks him if he would like some dessert. He accepts and they sit out on the balcony, having dessert and wine. He keeps saying how much he appreciates her. She finds this odd, because they really don't know each other that well yet. She realizes she's starting to feel uncomfortable.

Now she sees it in this man and she suddenly realizes that she has somehow fallen for the same trap again. She has fallen for the man with no face, the one who is unable to be real or true. She doesn't realize that he is a shapeshifter, but she knows that she's seen this exact scene play out before. It didn't go well before and she has no reason to believe that it will go well this time. In fact, she has every reason to believe that it won't.\n\nShe tells him that she's got a headache and would like him to leave. He seems startled by this. He asks her if she's breaking up with him. She tells him that they barely know each other, that there is no relationship to end. He looks so puzzled, she is taken back. She realizes that he has no idea what she's talking about. It is right then that she begins to suspect that something deeper is going on. She doesn't understand it, but she's starting to come to the realization that he is, in fact, the same man she just broke up with. She suspects that he is the same man she's broken up with many times. The realization that she's dating the same person over and over again is staggering.\n",
