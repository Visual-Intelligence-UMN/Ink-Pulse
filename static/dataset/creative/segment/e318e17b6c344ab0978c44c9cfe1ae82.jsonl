Tim and Jim know exactly the path to be taken in raising their children. Who will see to it that the children stay on the right path should Tim and Jim die of old age?

They will not allow the government to use their precious offspring as guinea pigs. Amy agrees, somewhat. She thinks that staying away from the mainstream will give her two years to observe side effects. If they are a nightmare, she will simply stay off the grid. Amy loves the little ones for whom she cares. She could be happy always being in their life. In fact, it is ideal for children to have two loving parents, and a fun, creative and loving governess. This just might turn out okay, afterall.\n\n\n",
