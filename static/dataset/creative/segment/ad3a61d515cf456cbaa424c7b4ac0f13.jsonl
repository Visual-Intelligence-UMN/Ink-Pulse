He is even more shocked when he finds out that he is the father of the child. \n\nMatt is not ready to be a father, and he is not ready to be married.

He knows that people on Earth have been looking for him relentlessly; they just don't know which planet he is on now. Matt sends a radio signal to planet Earth to let everyone know that he needs to be rescued immediately from Soeurette's planet, which is named \"Zorba\". Immediately, human forces are mobilized and a rescue platoon is sent into space to bring Matt back to Earth. Soeurette, of course, is not going to let Matt go without a fight. She is determined to keep Matt on her planet, and she is determined to keep him as her husband. In fact, she has already started wedding planning and has already booked a cake tasting, a caterer, a wedding menu designer, a dress tailor, and a wedding photographer.\n\nMatt is feeling increasingly annoyed by Soeurette, since she is not taking no for an answer. He also knows he cannot possibly have gotten Soeurette pregnant, since he has never slept with her. When the platoon arrives on planet Zorba, Matt immediately hops in with the rescue team. Soeurette pleads with him to stay, but Matt is determined to get back to Earth.\n",
