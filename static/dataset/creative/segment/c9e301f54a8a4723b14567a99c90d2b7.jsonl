Why would he come outside his house to make pizza? It wasn't as though there was an oven built into his backyard. But the wolf gestured at the pig through the little pig's window and showed the pig that he had brought an outdoor grill with him. \"I was thinking we could grill the pizzas together,\" he said.

So he decided to try to trick the little pig into coming outside. He decided to figure out what the little pig's favorite foods were. He found out that the little pig's favorite foods were pizza, beer, and ice cream. One day, the wolf came by the little pig's house with some ingredients to make homemade pizza. The wolf was like, \"hey little pig, I have some ingredients to make homemade pizza. You want to come outside and help me make it?\" The little pig laughed. Why would he come outside his house to make pizza? It wasn't as though there was an oven built into his backyard. But the wolf gestured at the pig through the little pig's window and showed the pig that he had brought an outdoor grill with him. \"I was thinking we could grill the pizzas together,\" he said. The little pig was intrigued. Grilled pizza was delicious! To seal the deal, the wolf said, \"I also have an ice chest full of cold beers and pints of Ben and Jerry's.\" The little pig was sold. The little pig opened up his door and approached the wolf. The wolf said, \"I'm glad you decided to come outside.

I'm just smart enough to know that if I came outside, you'd eat me.\" The wolf smiled at the little pig. \"So then what made you change your mind about coming outside?\" he asked. The little pig smiled back. \"Once I saw how much food you brought over, I figured that you'd just get full eating pizza and drinking beer and eating ice cream. I figured you couldn't eat all that and eat me too. And besides, I love all these foods!\" The wolf smiled at how gullible and ignorant the little pig was. The little pig's greed for the food had tricked the little pig into thinking that the wolf had a much smaller appetite than he actually had. In truth, the wolf had plenty of room in his stomach to eat lots of pizza in addition to the little pig. The wolf said, \"that's great, little pig. Let's get started on making the pizzas.\"\n",

I figured you couldn't eat all that and eat me too. And besides, I love all these foods!\" The wolf smiled at how gullible and ignorant the little pig was. The little pig's greed for the food had tricked the little pig into thinking that the wolf had a much smaller appetite than he actually had. In truth, the wolf had plenty of room in his stomach to eat lots of pizza in addition to the little pig. The wolf said, \"that's great, little pig. Let's get started on making the pizzas.\" While the wolf rolled out dough, the little pig spread sauce and cheese. But suddenly, the wolf turned to the little pig. \"Hey little pig, I just realized that I forgot to bring the pepperoni. Do you have any suggestions?\" The little pig shrugged. He wasn't a huge fan of pepperoni. But then the wolf said, \"I have an idea! I know exactly where I can get pepperoni.\" The little pig was confused. \"Where?\" he asked. The store was closed that day so there was nowhere close to get pepperoni. The wolf laughed. \"I can get it right from you.\" And he licked his lips and ate the little pig in a flash, teaching the little pig a lesson about greed. \n",

        "text": "Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had one hundred little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.\n\nThe 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, \"dude.\" The wolf wasn't too happy to learn that the little pig's house was built out of depleted uranium. After all, what good was such a house to him? He knew he would never be able to blow a house like this down and thus it would make it very difficult to make a snack out of the little pig. Of course, the little pig was a smart little creature and understood that was the whole point of building his house out of depleted uranium. \n\nThe wolf was a bit frustrated when he realized that he'd need to find another way to make a snack out of the little pig. So he decided to try to trick the little pig into coming outside. He decided to figure out what the little pig's favorite foods were. He found out that the little pig's favorite foods were pizza, beer, and ice cream. One day, the wolf came by the little pig's house with some ingredients to make homemade pizza. The wolf was like, \"hey little pig, I have some ingredients to make homemade pizza. You want to come outside and help me make it?\" The little pig laughed. Why would he come outside his house to make pizza? It wasn't as though there was an oven built into his backyard. But the wolf gestured at the pig through the little pig's window and showed the pig that he had brought an outdoor grill with him. \"I was thinking we could grill the pizzas together,\" he said. The little pig was intrigued. Grilled pizza was delicious! To seal the deal, the wolf said, \"I also have an ice chest full of cold beers and pints of Ben and Jerry's.\" The little pig was sold. The little pig opened up his door and approached the wolf. The wolf said, \"I'm glad you decided to come outside. I was afraid you were going to be a stick in the mud about this.\" The little pig laughed and said, \"I'm not a stick in the mud. I'm just smart enough to know that if I came outside, you'd eat me.\" The wolf smiled at the little pig. \"So then what made you change your mind about coming outside?\" he asked. The little pig smiled back. \"Once I saw how much food you brought over, I figured that you'd just get full eating pizza and drinking beer and eating ice cream. I figured you couldn't eat all that and eat me too. And besides, I love all these foods!\" The wolf smiled at how gullible and ignorant the little pig was. The little pig's greed for the food had tricked the little pig into thinking that the wolf had a much smaller appetite than he actually had. In truth, the wolf had plenty of room in his stomach to eat lots of pizza in addition to the little pig. The wolf said, \"that's great, little pig. Let's get started on making the pizzas.\" While the wolf rolled out dough, the little pig spread sauce and cheese. But suddenly, the wolf turned to the little pig. \"Hey little pig, I just realized that I forgot to bring the pepperoni. Do you have any suggestions?\" The little pig shrugged.

The store was closed that day so there was nowhere close to get pepperoni. The wolf laughed. \"I can get it right from you.\" And he licked his lips and ate the little pig in a flash, teaching the little pig a lesson about greed. \n\nThe moral of the story is that if you're a little pig, you should never trust a wolf.\n",
