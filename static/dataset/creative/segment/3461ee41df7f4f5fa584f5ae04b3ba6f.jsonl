Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.\n\nUpon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic. Mystified, he then thought what to do with the book. He decided to keep it a secret, and not tell anyone.\n",
