        "text": "Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had one hundred little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.\n\nThe 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. The uranium got to the pig and made him sick. So sick that he became zombie pig. He went out into the world and ate all the other pigs. That is what he enjoyed. Surprisingly the other pigs he ate wasn't his 99 brothers and sisters. They managed to get back to the farm. His brothers and sisters wondered what happened to 92 and if he was okay. \n\nThis is when 92 found the farm and found his brothers and sisters. 92 thought he had hit the jackpot. A place with 99 other pigs. He could be fed for years he though. He then got the idea to strike at night. None of the other pigs saw or knew of this plan. Night had then fallen. 92 prepared to go on his rampage. The other pigs where relaxing and enjoying each others company. When out of nowhere 92 jumped out of the bushes to attack. He attacked one of his sisters and bit her on the leg. His sister squealed in pain. The other pigs heard the squeal and went to see what was going on. They recognized 92 and wondered what madness was going on. The other pigs fought off 92 and pinned him to the ground. They then took him to the barn and tied him up. Surprisingly no one else was hurt. His sister was fine as well as she was taken care of. And since it was uranium that made zombie pig she wouldn't turn into a zombie.\n\nWhile 92 was hung up the other pigs wondered what to do. They didn't know how to get him back. One of them though maybe to ask mother pig what to do since she was not around when the chaos went down. They get her and she is happy to see 92 and is confused why he his hung up and shaking and squealing. She asks what happened and they tell her. She is shocked by the news. The mom gets close. She believes she can snap him out of it. She demands him to be cut down. The others say no he will bite. She says she must do it. They cut him down and he immediately leaps on his mom. But the mom ends up on top and pins him to the ground. She stares at him trying to get him to remember. The squirming of 92 begins to calm down. He is confused. Somehow his memories as a baby pig floods him. He remembers his mom and all the good times they had. He remembers his brothers and sisters and all the good time they had. He then says \"Mom\"? \"Yes honey I am your mom\" she replies. \n\nHe has snapped out of it. The rest of the pigs celebrate.  They all hug and kiss 92. They are happy that they all have their family back together in one place.\n",
