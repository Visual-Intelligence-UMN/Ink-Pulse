Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the \"Lost Generations\" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.  The drug causes those subjected to it to eventually develop a form of both retrograde, and anterograde amnesia  That is, the people subjected to the drug have forgotten all they ever knew, and are incapable of permanently learning new things.

They forget tool use, and while they're young, and healthy, they are unable to care for themselves.\n\nYou and the other \"Lost Gens\" are forced to take on the role of caretakers for the rest of the population, a role for which you are ill-suited, as you are all now in your 80s, or in some cases, even older, and increasingly sick, and frail. You are also small in numbers, and have to attempt to care for billions of people.\n\nYou do your best, but the situation seems hopeless. Finally, desperate, you decide to take the drug yourself, and see if you can't reverse the effects, and somehow save the world. Despite the scientists predictions of 'high risk', the drug has beneficial effects. It doesn't stop the aging process in the old, it gradually reverses it, and you find yourself slowly getting younger and healthier, and stronger.\n\nThe burden for caring for the rest of the world is eased, and you begin to feel hope. The end results of the age reversal process are not entirely clear, but you have faith that you will be able to reverse the effects of the drug, and you will be able to care for the planet's populace until you find a cure.\n",
