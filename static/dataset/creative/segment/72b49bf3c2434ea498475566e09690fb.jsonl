And you noticed a new movie screen appear in the room, next to the first and another new life started playing out. \n\nEveryone was connected. Connected to each other, the past, and the future. A soul gives birth to another, its twin at first, but then growing and changing as all twins do. It was a web of life, and you helped to shape it as well as be shaped by it. \n\nWith that understanding you looked back at the movies and learned. Soon, you too walked through the exit, and though the revelation about souls faded from your mind the feeling of connection, and caring for others as yourself remained. A new life began. \n",
