There were many protests and riots in the streets, but the government was able to quell them by promising that the Warriors would be used for good and it the only hope to fight the aliens. It wasn't until an attack by the aliens that killed thousands of humans happened that people became more accepting of the idea of unloading their mana. \n\nThe warriors would learn how to cast powerful and ancient spells at their training camp that would be able to kill the aliens with relative ease. Once the warriors began to be dispersed around the world to fight the threat, the tides began to turn in the humans' favor. They stood no chance against the power of the Warriors. \n\nAfter a few hard fought years, the aliens were totally driven off of the planet and the human race was saved. the Warriors around the world were hailed as heroes, and most of them returned their mana to the planet itself, which restored some of nature the aliens destroyed. Unfortunately. not everyone was willing to give up their mana.\n\nSome rogue Warriors went into hiding and have not been located since. These Warriors are roaming the world somewhere, still holding this incredible power. Now that the aliens are gone, the real threat is alive and well; power hungry humans. \n",
