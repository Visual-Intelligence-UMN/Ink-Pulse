The man replied, \"Oh, no, I almost died. I went into a coma and woke up years later and here I am.\". She replied, \"I'm so sure that you died. Everyone said that you died!\". He replied, \"No, I get that a lot but that's not what happened. I assure you that In ever died and me being right here is the proof!\". She said, \"Oh, well, wow, I'm so glad that you're ok!\". He replied, \"Thank you. So am I!\". Then she decided to go back home and tell her boyfriend about what just happened. \n\nLittle does she know that the man that she thought had died was actually the man that she's dating now. He just pretended to have died in order to become another man for her to date. So the woman went home and told her boyfriend everything. The boyfriend acted like he was empathetic and said that the man's really lucky to be alive. He also said, \"I know it sounds bad, but I'm glad that he died and that you didn't end up with that guy otherwise we wouldn't be together.\". \"Don't say that! That's so mean!\", she replies. \"Don't worry. I'm just kidding!\" he says. They watch a movie together and end up falling asleep on the couch. A few hours later she wakes up, turns to look at her boyfriend and sees that his face is the face of the man who she thought had died! The horror on her face is immense.\n\nShe screams in fear and yells, \"Who are you? Why are you here? What did you do with my boyfriend?\". The boyfriend replies, \"Whoa, calm down! I can explain everything!\". She replies, \"Get out of here and tell me how you got here!\". He then says, \"Look, I have to tell you something! You're gonna freak out but I have to tell you the truth. I'm your old boyfriend who you thought had died. I'm a shapeshifter and I pretended to be dead back then because our relationship wasn't going as well as I'd hoped and it was time for me to become someone else to start over and become a new man in your life.\". \n",
