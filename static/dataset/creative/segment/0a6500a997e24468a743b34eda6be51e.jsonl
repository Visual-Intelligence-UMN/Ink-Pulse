The exit door creaks open, and many of the crowd file towards it, including yourself. Upon leaving the theatre, the whole scene changes with disorienting rapidity. You find yourself in a very different place, much hotter, and with no film, or theatre air conditioning, and you know now that *this* is where you will be staying forever.\n\nAs it turns out, there are worse things than being bored for all eternity.
