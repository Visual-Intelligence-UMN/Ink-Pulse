It's an interesting experience to say the least, and one many humans fear. The universe that we live on is the only one we know. The unknown can be very scary to our minds. \n\nWe are social creatures, and we feel safe in our own realm. \n",

Whatever your belief is, reincarnation allows us to experience the many different roles we can play.\n\nWhat is it like to be a ghost? \n\nTo be a ghost is to be in purgatory. But it is not a painful experience, it is just very quiet and calm. It is almost like being in suspended animation. There is no time, there are no seasons, there is no physical pain. It's an interesting experience to say the least, and one many humans fear. The universe that we live on is the only one we know. The unknown can be very scary to our minds. \n\nWe are social creatures, and we feel safe in our own realm. To move on from the physical body is very challenging for many people. We have a comfort in our physical body. Many people are afraid to live off as a spirit in the spiritual world. They are used to their physical body. It is a safe feeling for a human. \n\nSome humans have the belief that when we die and move on, we go to a better place. That is the most comforting thought in regards to death. To many people, the afterlife is better than this Earth. Getting to spend life with the Holy Father, the Lord, God is what they believe their life's purpose is. Heaven is a wonderful place to be. It is a place where there is no pain, suffering, or any other negative experience. It is a place where we can live forever with the people who are most important to us.\n",
