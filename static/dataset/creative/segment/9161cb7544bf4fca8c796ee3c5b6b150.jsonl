And that woman you love will someday die, and also someday be reborn. So I offer you this; I will tie your soul to hers so that someday you will find her again. But I make no other promise. You will remember none of this, and she will be under no geas to choose you, in fact her experiences in this life may bias her against your soul. But you will still be tied to her\"\n\nYou thought about it. \"That is interesting, but the next time I see her she may be married or have children or...\"\n",

        "text": "When you die, you appear in a cinema with a number of other people who look like you. You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen.\n\n\"Well, this is getting tiresome,\" you thought. \"I'm in my next life, watching myself live it. And I am seriously boring this time around.\"\n\nBut then you began watching a beautiful girl. \"Well, that's new. Go for it me.\"\n\nAnd as you watched, the new? next? you did go for it. Asked her out and started dating her. It was amazing. You were a really good guy this time, and she was a happy girl who turned into a happy woman. \n\n\"Well, I guess this was worth it after all, if being so boring gets me a girl like that.\" You felt a deep contentment, and happiness. And as the movie progressed you found yourself look more and more forward to seeing her; it was almost like you were the one with her, rather than the next you. \n\nAnd for a while, that was true. But then, something unthinkable happened. The next you started acting cold and more and more distant. And then finally, he started cheating on her. You couldn't believe it, she was perfect and he was messing it up. But it kept going. And then one day, he finally just left her entirely, and your heart broke watching her heart break. \n\nThat's when you realized that you were in love with her. And soon, you would never see her again.\n\nYou screamed at the screen in agony and despair, and the next you simply smiled and left her. You raged around the theater as he just went on with his boring life and boring new girlfriend. You tried to damage the screen, upset the other yous, and more. Finally someone else appeared.\n\n\"Calm down,\" he said, and you turned around to see a tall skinny man in a black suit.\n\nThis was the first time since your death that you had been in the presence of anyone other than you. \"Who are you? And why should I listen to you? DO you know what just happened? I lost the love of my life, after my death, and now she is gone and I just don't...\"\n\n\"Calm down,\" he said again. \"Who I am isn't particularly important, other than this; I have an offer for you.\"\n\n\"What offer? Can I change his choice?\" you ask.\n\n\"No, you can have no effect on his life, it is his. But, one day you yourself will be reborn. And that woman you love will someday die, and also someday be reborn. So I offer you this; I will tie your soul to hers so that someday you will find her again. But I make no other promise. You will remember none of this, and she will be under no geas to choose you, in fact her experiences in this life may bias her against your soul. But you will still be tied to her\"\n\nYou thought about it. \"That is interesting, but the next time I see her she may be married or have children or...\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said.\n\nIt was a huge risk. A huge risk. But you looked around you, and looked with scorn at the man on the screen, the one you didn't even want to admit was you. \"I accept,\" you said. \n\nYou woke up one morning, looked at your clock and realized you were going to be late to work. \"Dang it, not again\"\n\nYou rushed out of your apartment building and ran towards the bus, just barely making it. As you sat down in the last seat you jeard a woman laugh gently next to you. You over at her, and realize she is the most beautiful, amazing woman you have ever seen.\n\n\"Hello,\" you say.\n\n\"Hello,\" she said back.\n\nIt was a good start to the day. The end.\n",
