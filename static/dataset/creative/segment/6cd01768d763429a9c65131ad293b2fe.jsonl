I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to keep you on the payroll anymore.\" You are stunned to get this news as your wife is giving birth to your first child. \n\nThe man is devastated. He feels like he's been kicked in the nuts. Meanwhile, his wife's water breaks and she starts screaming. The man is so upset that he doesn't even notice that his wife is in labor. He's too busy freaking out about his job. Even when the baby is crowning, he doesn't notice. \n\nThe man's wife is really upset. She's screaming and crying, and she's in a lot of pain. Frankly, she's a total mess and she's really starting to get on the man's nerves. The man realizes that this marriage is just not for him. He decides to leave his wife right then and there, because he realizes this whole time his heart was making him choose between his job and his wife and this experience has convinced him he cares more about his job than about being married. \n\nSo, he walks right out of the hospital and starts applying for jobs. You feel sympathetic to the man on the screen since you understand where he's coming from. At that moment, the lights in the theater dim, and the next film reel rolls, showing your next life. \n",
