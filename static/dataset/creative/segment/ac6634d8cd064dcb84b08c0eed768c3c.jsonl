There were no flowers in your room, but you still got scared by the sight of the bee being so close to you. You were frozen with fear, believing that if you ran away, the bee might end up stinging you from your sudden movement. You would have to wait, and hope that the bee would fly out the window, to find flowers elsewhere.\n\nThe bee had found its way around the room, until it landed on your desk. It crawled onto your textbook, and began moving across the page. You thought of closing the book, killing it in the process, but your were overcome with a sense of curiosity. The bee was small, and didn't look like it could hurt you. You continued to watch it move across the page, and against your better judgement, placed your hand on your textbook. Soon enough, the bee climbed onto your hand. It was warm, and you could feel its tiny body moving. You expected it to sting you, but it never did. Standing up, you then moved out of your room and went outside your house. \n",
