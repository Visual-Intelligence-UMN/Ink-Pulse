She learned basic spells such as creating a ball of light, laying down a few yards of flames around her, creating water from the air and blowing things away with a gust of wind.

Rather, she claimed to others to be a witch, with terribly powerful spells and incantations, in a world where magic doesn't exist. For the most part, many didn't believe her and found her to be too weird to hang out with. It worked fine for Emily, who was an introverted girl who kept to herself, often spending her free time alone with a good book. That is, until she stumbled onto a mysterious book hidden in her friend's bookstore one day.\n\nShe had come to the bookstore one night after work after leaving her house key, and ended up finding a hidden section of books that could be found only if you knew the exact location. She was mystified, she had been around the book store countless times, and even her friend did not tell her of this section. She believed it was just an ordinary book section, with other types of reading material. Looking through the books, she found they had intricate designs on their book spines and cover, but lacked any titles. Confused, she picked up a few. Opening each one showed the same outcome, the books were all blank. Every book in the section had no words written in them, except one that she found that looked out of place.\n\nShe picked up a book with a rather simple design on its cover, with a blue background and three circles orbiting around the center circle. Unlike the other books in the section, the book was titled, being called, \"Mana Invictum\". Being interested in the title, Emily opened the book and found it had text in it. More than that, it had writing in English, and wasn't just gibberish. The book was a magic book, that taught the user how to tap into Mana and wield magic. She was giddy with excitement, she would finally learn how to use spells like a witch.\n\nShe took the book home with her, and studied it for days. The book was complex on some parts, especially with some spells the book claimed was too dangerous to wield. Emily opted to learn a much more simpler spell to use, a spell that could illuminate her surroundings. Learning the correct ingredients to brew the spell's potion, she then drank it eagerly.
