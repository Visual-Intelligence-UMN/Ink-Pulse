        "text": "All of the \"#1 Dad\" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly.\n\nIt seemed like a normal day as Jeff staggered down the hall into the kitchen to make his morning coffee before taking a shower and getting ready for work. He grabbed for his \"#1 Dad\" mug that his kids got him for Father's Day last year. As he filled it with coffee he noticed that instead of saying \"#1 Dad\" it said \"#5467 Dad\" Jeff set the mug down and rubbed his eyes. He knew he wasn't quite awake yet. He looked at the mug again and sure enough, #5467. Huh, kids must be playing a joke. As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said \"#5467 Dad\". He was dumbfounded. \"They really went all in on this prank\" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. \n\nHe got dressed and headed off to work.\n\nAs he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on.
