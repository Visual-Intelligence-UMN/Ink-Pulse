They have to rebuild their country, and they have to learn to live with the other nations. There is no internet. There are no cell phones. They have to develop new ways of functioning.

Things run smoothly for a while. But then, there is a problem. They realize that they are not alone. There is a group of people who have been hiding from the world for the past 50 years. They have learned how to live and remain unseen and undetected. They are very secretive. It is how they have survived for so long. They have been watching the new world. They are impressed with their progress. They are impressed with how quickly they have been able to rebuild. They aren't sure whether they should contact them or move along. They decide to contact them. They weren't sure of the best way, so they decided to simply stop hiding. They would walk out into the open. One day, one of the members of the new world was out walking   in the woods. He saw a man walking out in the open. The man was wearing odd clothes, and looked like he was from somewhere else. The man was very intrigued. He introduced himself, and asked if the man had survived the war. The man said that he had. He asked how many of his people there are. \n",
