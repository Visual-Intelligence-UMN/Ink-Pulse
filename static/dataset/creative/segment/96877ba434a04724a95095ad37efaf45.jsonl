        "text": "Yesterday, you were laying in a hospital bed, unconscious from a severe car accident you were involved in. Today, you're of sound mind and body. Although as you would find, it wasn't your original body that you woke up in. You found yourself reincarnated, as a newborn to a new family.\n\nYou somehow were still aware of your past life. You realized that you must have died in the hospital yesterday, lamenting that your old body was deceased. You worried about your old friends and family, who were likely mourning your death. Eventually you come to terms with your situation, realizing it would be pointless to fret over something you can't change. You would have to grow up as a new person, and hopefully accomplish more than you had in your past life.\n\nThe more you grew up, the more you came to realize that something was off. Although you were in a different body, you were surprised that many things that happened in your past life also happened in your new life. Surely you thought, the concept of fate wouldn't apply to someone that was reincarnated? But there was too many coincidences in your life that you felt were too eerie and strange for them to be just coincidences. In your past life, at the age of 10, on your birthday you ended up breaking your right arm, after falling out of a jumper. Sure enough, on your second 10th birthday, you ended up breaking your right arm as well, this time after falling out of a tree. When you turned 18 and got your license, you ended up getting a speeding ticket on your first drive alone, just like in your past life. You were convinced that your new life was following the path of your old one. That idea worried you, as you wondered if your new life would end up in the same manner as your previous life.\n\nYou tried to push that thought away, trying different distractions to forget it and to enjoy your life. However, it became harder and harder for you to ignore the possibility. Especially as you are the same age when you first died, when at the age of 27 you got in a car accident after leaving work. You realize that such a thing could happen as well, and feared that you would experience the same fate. You try to remember the same date as the first accident, believing it was a wednesday in April, which was next month. To try to change fate, en every wednesday in March you would call in sick or use a vacation day to stay out of work. You even tried taking public transportation or walked to avoid driving on other days. May came soon enough, and you realized you had potentially changed the fate of your life. You feel asleep on the last day of April, content you were still alive unlike your past life.\n\nOn the first day of May, you woke up in a strange room surrounded by equipment. You realized you were back in the hospital, having come out of a month long coma. You realized your new life was but a dream, something your mind conjured during the coma. You would soon be discharged the next day, and return to your original life.\n",
