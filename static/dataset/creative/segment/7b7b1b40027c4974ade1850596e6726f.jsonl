The deal is complete. The bees have their land that they have total control over. You have the royal honey that will give you super strength. \n\nYou get home and twist the jar top off and look at the honey. Unlike regular honey, this honey is red. You go take a spoon out of a drawer and take a big bite of the honey. Unfortunately, the royal honey tastes so bad that you can't even swallow it.
