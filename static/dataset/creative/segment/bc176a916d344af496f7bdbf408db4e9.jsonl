They were so tall that they could easily walk on Mars without wearing oxygen masks. The Super Giants created their own cities on Mars where they could live peacefully. For the people in group B, they grew so tall that they could go to Earth by just floating. The people in group C could grow so tall that they could reach the stars. They all lived happily in Mars, Earth, and the stars.\n",

        "text": "When you're 28, science discovers a drug that stops all effects of aging, creating immortality. Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations\" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. I notice that those having taken the drug have their bodies grow in an exponential rate everyday. They quickly become the size of Giants. The society that was put in place to oversee the drug, and the giants it created, failed and they were released into the world. \n\nAs you can imagine, this is catastrophic. Many people become so tall that they need to wear oxygen mask all the time due to lack of oxygen at the levels where they breathe. The giants also need to inject 9 liters of water into their veins everyday just to survive. The world leaders have an emergency meeting to discuss the solutions to fix the problem. The Japanese and the Germans think about putting the giants into a satellite which would be launched into Mars where they could grow and live peacefully. Before the launch, there are over 10,000,000 giants who need to be divided into groups of how tall they are. The people over 100 meters tall are put into group A, people who are 80 to 100 meters tall are put into group B, and the rest of them put into group C. \n\nThe governments launched the satellite, and it reaches Mars in a month. The giants who are in group A, later called as \"Super Giants\" because of their immense size, grow so high that they are over 1000 meters. They are so tall that they could easily walk on Mars without wearing oxygen masks. The Super Giants create their own cities on Mars where they could live peacefully. For the people in group B, they grow so tall that they could go to Earth by just floating. The people in group C could grow so tall that they could reach the stars.  Many countries in the world have started developing new methods of growing food at a super fast rate in Mars. With the help from their governments, all the giants live happily in Mars, Earth, and the stars.\n",
