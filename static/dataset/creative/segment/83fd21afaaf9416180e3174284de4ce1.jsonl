What was now the President of all Presidents is an alien disguised as Matt Damon. Now that the alien has all of this power, he disables all security and allows the alien race to take over earth and enslave all humans. The only human that they allow to roam freely is the real Matt Damon, who they force to make movies for their entertainment because he is the one and only Matt Damon.\n",
