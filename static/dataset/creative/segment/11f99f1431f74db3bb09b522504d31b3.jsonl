It reads \"I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job.\" Signed simply, \"JFK.\"\n\nYou pause for a moment and think about what this could mean. You're not sure what the \"real job\" could be, but you're certain that JFK wouldn't have sent you a letter like this if it wasn't something essential to the security of the nation. So, you call the number and it rings a few times before a voice answers. It's JFK on the other end, of course. He tells you that he needs you to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. You remember their long time rivalry, so you're a little surprised that this is going to be a meeting, and not an assassination, and you tell him so. He responds \"Oh, it's going to be an assassination, and you're going to help me pull the trigger.\"\n\nSo, you agree to go to Cuba and meet with Castro. The public thinks he's dead, of course, but they think the same about JFK. You pack your luggage, and tucked under your suit, you also pack a silenced .22 pistol. Soon, the public will be right about one of these deaths.\n\nYou have no problems with customs, of course. You thought you'd be recognized, but it turns out that the public has no idea what you look like, out of office, you're just another black guy to them. When you reach the airport in Havana, you're met by a man who introduces himself as Castro's personal bodyguard. As you get in the limo that will take you to the presidential manor, you spot an undistinguished brown-haired man who you think to recognize for a second. You think to yourself \"I know that guy from somewhere...\" but you can't place him.\n\nYou shrug it off and go to the palace. You're greeted by Raul, of course, but spend little time talking to him. He's inconsequential. You're led to Fidel, and after preliminaries involving Cafe Cubano and Cohibas, you get down to business. The talk is ostensibly about loosening the U.S. embargo, and providing U.S. aid, but you're fingering the .22 pistol the whole time.\n\nThe bodyguard leaves. Now's your chance. \n\nYou pull the pistol out of your jacket and point it at Castro. Before you can squeeze the trigger, another shot rings out. Castro falls dead, his head a bloody ruin. You rush to the window, and see the brown-haired man from the airport, standing there with a smoking rifle in his hand. As the Cuban police descend on you, and hustle you off to prison, you recognize him as Lee Harvey Oswald.\n",
