The man pulls Rachel into a dark alley, away from the bustling city street. Another man, John, happens to see Rachel getting attacked by the stranger, and decides to help.

She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.\n\nOne day, Rachel, a beautiful young woman, is walking home from work when she’s attacked by a man. The man pulls Rachel into a dark alley, away from the bustling city street. Another man, John, happens to see Rachel getting attacked by the stranger, and decides to help. He grabs the man from behind and shoves him away from Rachel into a pile of garbage bags. The man turns around and looks at John, and then runs away. Rachel is relieved that the man has left her alone, thanks in part to John, who helped her. John and Rachel get to talking, and they realize they have a lot in common. Rachel decides to thank John by going on a date with him to a small, coffee shop the following day. Rachel meets John at the coffee shop and they get to know each other better over cappuccinos.
