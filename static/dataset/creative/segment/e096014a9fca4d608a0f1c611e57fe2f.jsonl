She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time. It all started one fateful evening, for the shapeshifter. For them, it was no problem getting a date. For whatever person they encountered, it was a matter of turning into their heart's desire, their heartthrob, or dream date. They could be anyone, and it was easy to get a date. However, the shapeshifter desired more, they wanted something long term. No matter who they dated, they never seemed to personally connect with their date. That was, until they met a special woman, sitting by herself at the bar. The shapeshifter was instantly smitten, and decided to make a move. They shifted into a young man, no older than her, and a form they had commonly used in the past. Perhaps they saw a model they wished to emulate, or it was an ex from a former date, they no longer knew at that time.\n\nThe shapeshifter approached the woman, and struck up a conversation. She was an artist, struggling at times, but looking for love nevertheless. She had only been in a relationship once before, but broke it off due to how abusive her ex was towards her.
