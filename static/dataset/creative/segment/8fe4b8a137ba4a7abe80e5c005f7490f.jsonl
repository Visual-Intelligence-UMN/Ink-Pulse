Not only was he assassinated on live TV, but he would be so old by now he may have even passed away due to old age. Perplexed by this, I called up my secret service detail to see if they knew what this was all about.  In the meantime, I ran to my closet and put on a nice seersucker suit because I wanted to look fashionable if this were true and i was going to meet such a legend. \n\nWhile I was getting ready and gathering some things, I got a call on cell phone. It was the secret service but not someone from my detail. The agent on the phone said they knew what was going on and asked me to walk outside and I should see a Dominos delivery car.  Confused, I hung up and walked outside. and lo and behold, a Dominos car was right in front my my door. It was driven by a man in a suit and sunglasses. \n\nHe gets out of the car and says \"Barack Obama Sir. I was sent to pick you up. Please come with me.\"\n\nI agree and sit in the car. The man drives me to the airport but we do not go in the usual way. He pulled up to a fountain nearby and honked his horn twice.

There was seemingly nothing else on the island. Once the engine shut off, the pilot ushered me off and another man in a suit was waiting to escort me. He greeted me and then had me follow him down a path towards what looked like the front door. \n\nWhen we got to the door, he knocked three times and it slid open with no one the other side. \n",

We took the elevator down a few stories and the man explained to me that \"the others\" will be waiting for me in the conference room a few stories down.\n\nWhen the elevator stopped, the doors opened and I was in a large room with a table in it. Sitting at the head of the table was a man I thought I recognized. He beamed and walked over to the elevator door to greet me.\n\n\"Hello Mr Obama, thank you for coming on such short notice. I am John Kennedy.\" I stared at the man. He was indeed JFK, standing right in front of me.\n\n\"What is going on?\" I asked confusedly.\n\n\"Let me explain everything, I think everyone is here.\"\n\nJFK motioned for me to sit down and he began a speech. I blacked out for a second and woke up in my bed back at home. It was all a dream. I looked at my phone and had a text from someone calling themself JFK, asking me to meet them for a mission. Here we go again.\n",
