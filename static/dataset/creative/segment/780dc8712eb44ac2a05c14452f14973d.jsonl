You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen.\n\nThis was very exciting for me. I couldn't wait to see who I would become next. I was hoping for something really cool, like a famous footballer or a rock star. But I wasn't famous at all. I was a boy in a small village in the mountains of Nepal. I lived a very simple life with my family in a house that my parents built from wood that we gathered. I was very sad to see that I was so poor. But the boy I would become was not sad at all. He enjoyed his simple life. He was happy with his family and friends in the village in the mountains. And then I realized that this boy does in fact have a peaceful life. He isn't sad about not being famous. He cares more about the life he has. I realized that I should be more like him. But wait I was him. \n\nPerhaps in this next life I learned how to be happy with what I have. I, when playing the boy on the screen, learned that I should be grateful for what I have, instead of wanting more. And the boy was happy. He didn't care about being famous. He didn't care about having a lot of money. And I thought that this was great.\n\nI looked around in the theater and saw that everyone else was happy too. All of the previous versions of me were rejoicing in their seats as it seemed my soul had learned a valuable lesson.\n\nI was very happy to see that I had learned something so important.\n",
