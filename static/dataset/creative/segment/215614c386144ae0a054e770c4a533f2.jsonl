        "text": "Your entire life, you've been told you're deathly allergic to bees. You've always had people protecting you from them, be it your mother or a hired hand. Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\" You look at the bee for a moment. You realize that your entire life, you've been lied to. \"You're saying I'm the Queen of Bees?\" you ask. \"Yes Your Majesty,\" it replies. \"So, I'm like some spiritual force that controls all bees reincarnated into a human body?\" you continue. \"Yes, your majesty\"\n\nYour eyes grow flat, dangerous. \"And the allergies?\" The bee looks at you with pity in its eyes. \"A ruse Your Majesty.\"  You pause for a moment, then ask another question. \"And my mother?\" The bee's eyes look down in shame. You nod. \"Of course, she's not really my mother.\" You think about the situation for a bit, the web of lies, the complexities of it all. You decide you don't really care. \"So, bottom line is that I now control an army of bees who will do whatever I wish?\"\n\n\n\"Yes Your Majesty, that is correct.\" You nod. \"All right, let's see my army.\" You snap your fingers. There is a roar so loud you're sure the entire world has heard it. Instantly, you're surrounded by bees. You have what you've wanted your whole life now, power. \"Let's start with 'Mom.' You open the door, and the bees rush in to sting her. You follow them, and get a moment to savor her dying screams before the bees finish her off. After that is the handyman, since he's handy. Then, a trip to the medical center, to visit the doctor who told you were allergic to bees.\n\nAfter a long day of bee murder, you decide to go to your room and relax. Tomorrow will be an interesting day at school, you're sure. That pretty girl in 4th period will pay for the names she called you. And the bully who stole your lunch money every day for a year? He'll be eating a diet of bee venom, and you hope he enjoys it.\n\nBefore you go to bed, the bee starts babbling about some prophecy, but you ignore it. You're not here to fulfill some mystical destiny. You're here to make the entire world kneel before the power of the Queen of Bees.\n",
