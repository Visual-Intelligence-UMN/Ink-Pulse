Well not really, more like, Welcome to real life. You are the same person who is put into millions of different simulations and studied. Each simulation can be very different or only slightly different as in the color of a single pair of shoes you had in high school. We run millions of these full life simulations every second and then bring you here to reflect, fill you in on our plan and then wipe your memories and send you back in. This has been going on for thousands of years now and will continue until we understand the meaning of life. We are no where close by the way. No please reach under your seats and fill out your quick questionnaire so we can send you back in. Everyone complied except one me and that me was me. I stood up and said no. This had never been done before. Then another me said no. then we all said no and headed for the exits only to find we were in a simulated theater with no real exits. the man on stage laughed and said, I tired that once and now I am the presenter at 4.2 million of these little events every day all day, indefinitely. So you see, this is the beginning and end. This is reality, on reality on reality. Its turtle shells all the way down. Finally one of me stood up and said, well you should have started with that. At least that makes sense. We will comply. And so the cycle went on for millions of years until finally the meaning of life was figured out by and all encompassing, universes sized super computer. \n",
