They just waddled around, unable to make sense of anything. They all looked young and were in great shape but they were green! As we \"Lost Generation\" members started to grow in age this presented a huge problem. Society started to crumble completely since everyone young stopped working or being able to take on any responsibility. Everyone left to take care of the world is now really old and we just don't have the energy anymore. I'm able to grow a garden and care for myself still, but the time will eventually come when all of us old ones will pass. What's next for humanity seems a sad story indeed because when we are all gone it will be only them left. The young ones. The green people. I guess they'll just wonder aimlessly until they become prey of some large animal. They called us lost in the beginning. But now, humanity is lost, fallen victim to the evil drug. And that is how it will end. \n",
