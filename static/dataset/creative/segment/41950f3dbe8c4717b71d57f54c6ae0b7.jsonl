        "text": "Following World War III, all the nations of the world agreed to 50 years of strict isolation from one another in order to prevent additional conflicts. 50 years later, the United States comes out of exile, only to learn that no one else went into isolation. The United States is now an obsolete superpower. China is has now taken the powers that the United States once had. This makes American pissed. They have now lost their status as number one. Turns out no one really likes China being number one either. Countries that China took advantage of during World War III now want revenge.\n\nOne thing China didn't expect was the US to be so strong even after isolation. All of their military is still in place. The troops have been training. All the ships, tanks, and submarines are still theirs. And no countries like the UK, Japan, Canada, and many others want the US to be number one again. So they device a plan to attack China. China is still oblivious to all of this. They are in their own bubble thinking that everything is going swell. The plan is to attack China's capital when they least expect it. The surprise attack and numbers means China will be caught with their pants down and won't be able to put up a good fight. Then they will attack the government building holding the prime minister and many other important people. China is not alone, however. Not all countries hates China and will surely back them up.\n\nSo they US and allies begin their attack. They are going under a disguise. You see Korea was acting merely as allies of China but the whole time hated them as well. So the troops will be disguised as Korean troops which China will not see as a threat. All of the vehicles are disguised as well. They make it to the government building. Then the firing starts. The government building is attacked and the US troops start taking out the guards. It is so easy for the US troops. Nothing is stopping them. They are too strong. China tries to retaliate but are easily wiped with the number difference. The US is on a clock though. They have to get China to surrender before their allies come and the war become a huge one.\n\nSince all the guards are taken out the building is easily penetrated. They go in, subdue the guards, and capture the prime minister and others. China is easily outnumbered. 20 Chinese to the 100's of soldiers. The US makes it points clear. They want China to surrender. They want China to give up everything and will give them what they think is fair. If they do not comply they will all be executed due to their crimes from the last 50 years. China of course gives up and tell their allies to stand down and there is nothing they can do. \n",
