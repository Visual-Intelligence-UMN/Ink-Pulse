This is a story about the 92nd little pig.\n\nThe 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, \"dude.\" \"Don't you know that stuff causes cancer?\" The pig replied , \"I'm not going to be here that long.\" \"What do you mean?\" asked the wolf.  The pig answered , \"I'm going to blow this popsicle stand.\" \"Huh?\" began the wolf, but before he could get another word out, the pig pressed a button and blew up the house and the wolf, and himself, and everything within a ten mile radius.\n\nAn alarm went off in the house of the 92nd little pig's wife, where she was raising the 93rd little pig. She knew what it meant. \"Operation No Wolf\" had been a success. The wolf had been eliminated, and since he was the last of his line, there would be no more wolves to harass little pigs in the future. This meant that she could now raise her little pig in peace.\n\nSo, that's what she did. She raised the little pig to be thoughtful, and curious, and without wolves to worry about, he became a very intelligent, and curious, and considerate little pig. When he was 18, he decided to go to college, and he studied hard, and he graduated with honors. After that, he attended Yale Medical School, and he became a doctor. He specialized in treating little pigs with cancer, and was one of the most respected oncologists in the world. He worked tirelessly, and with the efforts of his crack team the pig and his fellow researchers were able to develop a vaccine that would cure cancer in little pigs.\n\nThe cure worked, and the pig was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine. As he stood on the stage, accepting his reward, he was asked who he wanted to thank for his achievements. He paused for a moment, and said \"Well, strange as it may sound, I have to thank an exploding dep\n",
