More important than that, what am I the queen of? You walk outside and start to hear a buzzing noise as you get closer to your car. All of a sudden you can see a bee flying around you. You are allergic, so you begin to become a little nervous. Moments later, many more bees swarm around you. The bees all come to a still motion, still flying but not moving back and forth. A little bee lands on your shoulder and says \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\". You swat at the bees, but they fly back to their original formation. What is going on? You can't stop thinking about the man in the trench coat and fedora. What did he do to me? Why did he say I was a queen and all my dreams would come true? The bees all start laughing. \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\" they say. \"Why are you all calling me majesty?\" I asked the bees. \"Because you are the queen of course! We're your servants and we will do anything for you.\n",
