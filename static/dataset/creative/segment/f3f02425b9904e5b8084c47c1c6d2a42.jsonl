This is a story about the 92nd little pig.\n\nThe 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, \"dude.\" The 92nd little pig didn't care about the wolf's unsolicited opinion. The 92nd little pig was happy on his pile of uranium. \n\nThen one day, the wolf knocked on the door of the 92nd little pig. He was surprised that the wolf would come around, given his previous attitude. The wolf knocked and the 92nd little pig didn't play the game the first 3 little pigs had played. He opened the door, careless and without fear. The wolf did not eat him. He simply asked to come inside for a few minutes. The 92nd little pig let him in, because he was a polite pig and not the kind of person that would kick someone out in the middle of a story.\n\nThe wolf sat down and the pig served refreshments. They talked about the weather and their families. They slowly got to know one another and some trust had been built. At that point, the wolf made a confession to the pig. The wolf confided in the pig that he had been suffering from depression. He asked the 92nd little pig how he kept such a great attitude toward life, after having been dealt such a disappointing hand. \n\nThe 92nd little pig told the wolf that he didn't always have this amazing outlook on life. He explained that, when he first moved into his little house on the hill of depleted uranium, he had felt defeated and saddened. He felt as depleted as that uranium his life was built upon. But then, one day, he had a revelation. He was looking at everything from the point of view that he was guaranteed some lot in life, that would resemble the lives of the first 3 little pigs. He was the 92nd little pig, and his life would be different. It would look different, but could be every bit as enjoyable and as great an adventure. He was determined to make a positive impact on the world, as well.\n\nHe had started doing some volunteer work at the pig hospital, where there were many little pigs that were much worse of than himself. He explained that this had given him the perspective that he needed to break out of his depression. The wolf listened thoughtfully and reached a kind of revelation of his own. He had never done anything nice for anyone. He always ended up being the big bad wolf, when really he just wanted to be plain old wolf. \n\nThe 92nd little pig invited the wolf to go with him to the hospital. The went together, to work for their community that day. They have been working together every since, and their story is even more famous now, among sick little pigs, that the story of the first 3 little pigs.\n",
