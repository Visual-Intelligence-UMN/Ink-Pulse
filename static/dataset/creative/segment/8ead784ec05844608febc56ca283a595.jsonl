You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. You are surprised to see that you have changed from a man into a chipmunk.\n\nYou then follow the progress of your life as a chipmunk. Digging holes in the dirt seems to be an important activity. You try to avoid predators and eat plenty of acorns. One day, an osprey dives nearby and snatches your firstborn. You watch him carry off your child.\n\nYou vow revenge. After a few years, you are digging near an apple tree when an osprey arrives to snatch your second child. You grab its wing with your teeth and hang on for dear life. The bird flies away with you, scraping the ground. Your second child is behind you, safe. But you've got other problems. You are flying over a cliff, and you know that the bird is about to drop you.\n\nThis doesn't look good. You are about to fall to your death. But then you have an idea. You release the bird's wing, tuck your head into your chest, and pull in your legs.\n\nThe blue water wheels crazily below you, getting ever closer. Then you notice that a nearby hawk is also flying at the edge of the cliff. It dives for you. You spread out your body and become a parachute. Your speed diminishes, and the water straightens below. You land safely on a branch, just above the water. The hawk alights just beside you.\n\nThe hawk then begins to talk. \"So that was fun eh?\" she says with a squawk. \"You know,\" she continues, \"I'm really glad that I was able to save you.\"\n\n\"Why?\", you ask the hawk.\n\nShe answers, \"Because I'm a woman.  And I'm all woman.\"\n\nYou're not sure what she means. \"And I'm all chipmunk,\" you remind her.\n\n\"So what\", she responds. \"Love is love.\"\n\nThe End.\n",
