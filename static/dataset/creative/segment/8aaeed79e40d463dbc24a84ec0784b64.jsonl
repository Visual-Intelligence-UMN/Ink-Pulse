These quote, side effects, unquote, are great! It's like suddenly all of my senses are heightened, in a good way. Everything tastes better, everything I touch feels better, things smell great.

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations\" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.\n\nYou had always suspected there would be side effects. With a drug that strong, that amazing how could there not be? It was just a matter of time. It was always kind of a little solace that, even though you weren't going to live forever, that you had been too old for the drug, that at least you wouldn't have to deal with the side effects either. \n\nWhen the side effects are discovered, you're not a happy camper. At first there was a kind of collective experience when the government announced that side effects had been confirmed. That was all the initial press release said. People got really worried, and it was all any one talked about that day. \n\nThe next day there was a press release stating that the side effects were really low level, that most people wouldn't even notice them, and that more information would be released in the next week or so. \n\nYou, like most people, were impatient and didn't want to wait that long. Call it schadenfreude, or concern for younger friends and family who had received the drug, or just distrust in the government.   Whatever but you wanted to know what was going on, and you didn't want to wait for the government's sanitized version. You started reaching out to all of your old friends, the ones who had been just a couple of years younger than you, and had gotten the drug. They were among the first to receive it; if there were side effects they would probably be experiencing them. \n\nIt was hard to reach out to them. There had been a lot of bitterness back then, and jealousy. They were the ones who had gotten the thing you wanted, and it had made them very popular. But still, you needed to know. So you called Jack. He was one of the first to receive the drug. He had always been a little arrogant, but you could tell him anything.\n\n\"Hey Jack, I know we haven't talked in forever, but with all this news about The Drug, I just wanted to check in on you...\" you began.\n\nThe man on the other end started laughing. \"Yeah, right, your just hoping to hear something terrible has happened to me. But I get it buddy, I know it was hard all of those years ago to know you were going to get old, while I would stay 25 forever. Just human nature.\"\n\nYou grit your teeth - he may be a dying jerk, but he was still a jerk. \"No, but really Jack, how are you.\"\n\n\"Great, never been better. We're not supposed to tell people, but I can tell you are dying with curiousity, and given how old you are, I don't think your heart should be under that much strain. These quote, side effects, unquote, are great! It's like suddenly all of my senses are heightened, in a good way. Everything tastes better, everything I touch feels better, things smell great. Its truly amazing. Right as I was getting bored with this body and life, BAM, something happens to make me appreciate it all over again. Seems like it is going to be permanent too.\"\n\nHe kept going, but you hung up. You were too angry, and your heart was beating too fast.\n",
