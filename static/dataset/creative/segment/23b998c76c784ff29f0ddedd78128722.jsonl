Many of the countries that suffered from isolation ended up going into conflicts with one another, for resources and other material goods that it had lacked during the isolation. Trade battles and other economic struggles occurred between the biggest nations of the world, dragging the smaller countries into it causing them to suffer as well. It turns out that isolation was not the answer to the world's problems, and that the only way for nations to survive was for them to communicate with one another.\n",

This means that the countries will not be able to travel outside of their borders, nor communicate with other nations. This was approved by many if not most of the nations of the world, and was backed up by countless experts who agreed that isolation was needed for the world to stabilize itself.

However, the satellites were never utilized in the hundred of years of isolation. In fact, it appeared as if most countries were fine during isolation, able to recover economically and become stable as experts had predicted. There were no wars or conflicts, and the world continued to move on without major issues that would involve many nations around a singular issue. In fact, the only thing that seemed to really be a problem was that international trade was basically nonexistent. As per the rules of isolation, many countries were prohibited from trading with other countries goods and services. This proved problematic for some countries, but the lack of communication via satellites during the duration of the satellites suggested that those countries would find domestic means to satisfy their resource needs.\n\nThe year 2112 eventually arrived, and communications between countries were re-established. However, it was soon discovered that there were major issues that had arisen in the absence of communication and trade throughout the world. Many of the third-world countries had been able to make due during the isolation, but the first-world countries had suffered from the lack of trade, in addition to other economic issues. These countries for whatever reason it may be did not chose to use the satellite communication during the period of isolation, out of pride and fear that the other countries would view them as vulnerable.
