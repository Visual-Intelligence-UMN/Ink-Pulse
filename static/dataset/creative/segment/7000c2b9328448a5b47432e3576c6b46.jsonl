The team consisted of a biker named Crunch, an expert marksman named Bullet, and a male nurse named Poison. All of them were hand-picked by Armstrong and each member had a specialty they could contribute to the team.  After their initial briefing, the team became familiar with each other and were ready for the mission. The US government had placed them undercover and in the same building as the foreign agency, they would be stealing information from. They were prepared for anything and would steal the information directly from the UN which houses information on all countries. \n\nThe team was able to successfully infiltrate the United Nations and steal all the files they needed. The team meets back at the safehouse and gets congratulated by the president. They were told they did an amazing job and were now able to use this information to get the United States back into the global scene.

        "text": "Following World War III, all the nations of the world agreed to 50 years of strict isolation from one another in order to prevent additional conflicts. 50 years later, the United States comes out of exile, only to learn that no one else went into isolation.\n\nThis news was devastating to the United States. After coming out and finding out the news, the US formed a special team to try and catch the country back up to pre-war levels. The US government appointed a young man named Brad Armstrong to lead this team. Armstrong had a great experience in the world of motorcycle racing and was seen by officials as the perfect man to lead this team. He was a man that people could look up to in times of crisis and follow their lead. Brad begins to examine the successes of other countries and what the US would have to do in order to catch up. To get accurate information they would need to infiltrate the foreign governments and steal their secrets.
