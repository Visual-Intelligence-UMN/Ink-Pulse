Matt Damon is not only a national treasure, but he is well regarded in nations all around the world. Because of this, the nations will band together to free him from the evil clutches of the alien emperor. \n\nThe United Nations put together a task force of some of the world's best agents. Each of them will be a specialist on one aspect of the operation. Failure in this mission is not an option. The crew underwent some rigorous training exercises to prepare them for blasting off into space. They also had to undergo a lot of physical fitness and weapons training. Since this was a secret mission, they got to use some top secret weaponry the general public does not know about. \n\nThese agents will need to battle space pirates, smugglers, and of course the alien emperor, so the best weapons were needed for the journey. \n\nThe day of the mission finally came. The agents went to the spaceport in England and boarded their rocketship. The rocketship took off to space and blasted toward their destination. It was going to be a quick flight since the intel received by the UN says that the aliens are not too far away from the moon at this point. \n\nOnce the rocket breached the atmosphere, the shuttle broke off of it and the pilot took over the controls. The navigator used some intel and radar to scan the space and pinpointed the alien spacecraft. The navigator gave the directions to the pilot and he drove the shuttle off in that direction. \n\nThe alien spacecraft was not too far away, but as the crew got closer they noticed something odd. There was a fleet of smaller ships following the alien ship closely behind. They were space pirates! Surely they had the same idea and wanted to capture Matt Damon for themselves. \n\nThe UN task force needed to act fast. They sent two gunners to some turrets the shuttle was equipped with and they began blasting away at the space pirate ships. One by one, they exploded. Before the pirates could even react or retaliate, they were all defeated. \n\nThe space shuttle went for the alien spacecraft and pursued it to prevent any other space pirates from taking Matt Damon. They were hot on their tail when a radio transmission came in from the alien emperor. The emperor said that they were taking Matt to their home planet to star in some movies made by them, so they can have their own entertainment. The UN space shuttle was not going to accept this. the commander of the mission warned the aliens to surrender Matt Damon or else they were going to blow up their ship and their planet. The emperor looked worried. He decided to try to cut a deal with the agents. \n\nThe emperor tried to negotiate giving them another actor for their movies and they will return Matt Damon unharmed. \n",
