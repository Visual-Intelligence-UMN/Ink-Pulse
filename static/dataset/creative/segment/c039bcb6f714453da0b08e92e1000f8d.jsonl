He was certain he was doing the right thing. He had to do this. But he was so afraid of losing her again. Each time he dated her she seemed more cautious, more skittish, and would break up with him for more and more minor things. He had to do this, he had to tell her.\n\nHe entered the shop, and smiled at Tracy walking over. \"It'll be ok, I can make this work,\" he though to himself as they sat down.\n\nThey chatted for a while, normal things, how their day was, what was new at work. And then Jeff looked at Tracy with a serious expression. \"Oh no,\" she thought \"he is going to ask me to move in.\"\n\nJeff took a deep breath. \"We've been dating for a little while now, and you know I am completely in love with you. But I have to tell you something.\" Jeff looked at Tracy's expression, and could see she was bracing herself. His heart sank a but, but he continued. \"This has nothing to do with how much I love you, and I really do want to be close to you, but...I don't think I'll ever want to move in with you.\"\n\nTracy was shocked. This was literally the last thing she has ever expected. Her hopes began to rise. \n\nHe continued \"It's not you I swear! I've just..had some bad experiences. And I've gotten so used to living alone and having a lot of space. And to be honest I've never really like that marriage had to be a legal thing rather than just a commitment between people. I'm totally comitted to you, and I'll always be there for you. But I needed you to know I can't live with you, or have a traditional marriage.\"\n",

She had been dating guys for a long time, but it never seemed to work out. She knew it was mostly her fault. She had secrets she just couldn't tell anyone.
