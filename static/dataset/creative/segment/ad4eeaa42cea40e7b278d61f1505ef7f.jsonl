You look at the bee, then back at your hand, then let out a yelp and leap backwards when you see another bee. The first bee speaks. \"Your subjects are swarming to you.\" Indeed, you see more bees drawing near you, emitting a strangely-reassuring buzz.\n\nThe second bee flies closer to you. You flinch, but as you look at it, it conveys an unmistakable impression of patience and wisdom. \"You're confused.\" it says in a kindly voice. \"Let me explain.\" You wait. \"You have always been in the royal line.\" it explains. \"One of your ancestors was a queen, and she had a child with a mortal man. All your life, you've been told that you're allergic to bees. This lie was perpetrated by your mother, who is really your stepmother.\"\n\nYou gasp. \"She is from a rival hive.\" continues the bee. \"She intends to usurp your throne.\" You think about this, and the fact that you've never been all that close to your 'mom', and she looks nothing like you, and wonder about your father. \"What happened to my dad?\" you ask the bee. \"Your father was murdered,\" it says, \"and your stepmother had a hand in that.\"\n\n\"Why have you just told me about all this now?\"\n",
