Though you are still doubtful, you are charmed by the bee's persistence.\n\nYou inform the bee that you will need time to acclimate to bee culture. You want to be informed of any and all legislation that is proposed in the bee council. The bee agrees to the logic of this cautionary approach and soon you are learning all about the bee world. You're astonished by the intricacies of bee society.\n\nBees all have different personalities and they are very thoughtful, once you get to know them. You begin to think of the bees as your children, and you care for them. You spend many hours talking to the bees about their problems and their aspirations. When you are finally ready to give your first order to the bees, it is an order to form a great celebration. You want a grand coronation as king of all bees. The bees are overjoyed, and they begin preparations immediately.\n\nWhen the celebration finally comes, it's a great day and a huge hit. All the bees, especially the youngest among them, have the best day ever. All of the bees come together and you rule as the king for many years. \n",
