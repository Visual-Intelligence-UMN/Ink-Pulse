When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again.\n\nToday is the culmination of all of our hard work; the energy from the Mana would be focused into a vessel, granting them extraordinary power.

It was beautiful. \n\nThe light seemed to be taking a form, and I could see a shape in the center of the light. It was a man, with a long, flowing cloak.
