        "text": "Based on ancient texts, scholars had concluded that humans once wielded formidable magical power. However, the source of energy that once spanned the Earth that gave humans the ability to wield magic, Mana, had mysteriously vanished in the past. Today, most are unaware that humans had wielded magic in the past, as technology had replaced it and was now what modern civilization depended on. That is until, a group of explorers stumbled upon a mysterious temple, in the jungles of Central America.\n\nThe explorers were a group of scientists and archaeologists, who were studying the ancient ruins of the temple. They were not sure what was the purpose of the temple, but they were surprised to see that it was in good shape despite how ancient it appeared. The explorers decided to explore the temple, and were surprised to see that it was filled with strange artifacts. Upon examining the artifacts, they learned it was a form of written records, that detailed the energy source that other more modern texts referred to as Mana. The researches were pleased, they had found the oldest records on the planet that mentioned Mana, meaning that the people that built the temple could also tap into it to wield magic. \n\nThe researches were excited to learn more about the ancient civilization that had built the temple, but they were surprised to find that the temple was far bigger than it appeared from the outside. They ventured deeper into the temple, taking note of its pristine design and craftsmanship. They ventured deeper, wondering to themselves if they should turn back, until they stumbled on the main chamber of the temple. In the main chamber was a large room with a massive stone slab in the middle of it. The stone slab appeared to be written in an ancient language, with some archeologists being able to translate it once they took a closer look at it. The translated text revealed that the slab was a record of the civilization that built the temple, and their discovery of Mana. The slab surprisingly, also detailed how Mana was created by the civilization. It revealed that the civilization had used Mana to create a powerful weapon, that they used to fight off a powerful enemy, that was not from this planet. The machine to create Mana was thus submerged into the ocean, so it would not fall into the wrong hands. What remaining Mana that was created, was mentioned by the slab would be temporary, and would eventually run out.\n\nThe explorers were shocked by the discovery, and decided to inform the world of their discovery. Thus several countries around the world took on many endeavors to scan the ocean for the ancient machine, in the hopes of creating more Mana. For many, the purpose may as well have been nefarious , as the Mana could be used to create powerful weapons.\n",
