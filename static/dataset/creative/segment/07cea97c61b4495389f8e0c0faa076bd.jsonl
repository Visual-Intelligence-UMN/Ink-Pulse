An amorphous blob with no discernible shape, something she had not seen before in her life. Surprised, she inadvertently let out a gasp and ran back to the couch. Mike, heard the commotion, and realized Clara had seen his true form. He quickly changed back into Mike, and went back to see Clara.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you,\" Mike said, as he sat back down next to her.\n\nClara was speechless, she did not know who or what was truly staring back at her with seemingly human eyes.\n\n\"The truth is, I am a shapeshifter, and this is the 6th time I've been on a date with you\", Mike said with hesitance in his voice.\n\nClara was surprised, all of her ex's were the same person, a shapeshifter that was seemingly infatuated with her. \n\n\"I know it's hard to believe, but I really do like you, and I want to be with you,\" Mike said, as he reached for her hand.\n\nShe grabbed it, and pondered, perhaps she was being a bit hard on him. She wondered how hard it might be for him to form a long-time relationship, and if others like him were successful in doing so. Smiling at him and motioning at the TV, Clara and Mike resumed the movie, continuing their date. They continued to date long into the future, now closer to each other given that Clara is aware of Mike's true identity. \n",

        "text": "A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She seems to date a wide variety of men, being open-minded for any chance of of finding her soul mate. She is unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time.\n\nIt started just like any other date for the woman, she seemed to have hit it well with the man, who appeared suddenly as she was getting her daily coffee. He seemed to share her favorite interests, he liked the same type of coffee, and he was into the same kind of music she liked to hear. Granted, many of her ex's were the same, sharing many of her favorite interests and hobbies. To her, however, Mike seemed to be a bit different than her past dates. He seemed a bit mellow and reserved, being passive and waiting for her to speak and make the first move. A welcome change than her past dates, who seemed to be more active and confident. On the date, Mike still appeared meek and nervous.\n\n\"Relax, I'm not going to bite you,\" Clara mentioned to Mike, who looked down on the menu to avert his eyes from hers. \n\n\"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable,\" Mike spoke, in a tone just above a whisper.\n\nSure enough, the dinner went fairly well, and she was content to be with Mike. They decided to watch a movie together, at his house later that day.\n\nIn the midst of the movie, Mike excused himself, mentioning his urgency to go to the restroom. Come to think of, Clara thought, Mike goes to the bathroom quite often. He had done so very often during dinner, and seemed to still want to go during the movie. Curious, Clara paused the movie and tip toed to the bathroom.\n\nThe door was unlocked, and she peered inside. Clara was shocked, to see Mike transforming back into his true form. An amorphous blob with no discernible shape, something she had not seen before in her life. Surprised, she inadvertently let out a gasp and ran back to the couch. Mike, heard the commotion, and realized Clara had seen his true form. He quickly changed back into Mike, and went back to see Clara.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you,\" Mike said, as he sat back down next to her.\n\nClara was speechless, she did not know who or what was truly staring back at her with seemingly human eyes.\n\n\"The truth is, I am a shapeshifter, and this is the 6th time I've been on a date with you\", Mike said with hesitance in his voice.\n\nClara was surprised, all of her ex's were the same person, a shapeshifter that was seemingly infatuated with her. \n\n\"I know it's hard to believe, but I really do like you, and I want to be with you,\" Mike said, as he reached for her hand.\n\nShe grabbed it, and pondered, perhaps she was being a bit hard on him.

Smiling at him and motioning at the TV, Clara and Mike resumed the movie, continuing their date. They continued to date long into the future, now closer to each other given that Clara is aware of Mike's true identity. Mike himself, decided to stop lying to Clara about who he is and regarding his personality, and found that she liked him quite more than the first time they went on a date. For Mike, it was a happy period of his life, for despite being a shapeshifter, he found a form that was well accepted by the one he loved the most.\n",
