Why don't I just show you?\" The alien took out a second taco and ate it in one bite. \"Here, watch this,\" said the alien. Matt Damon wasn't sure what happened next or how the alien did it, but a moment later he was standing in a Taco Bell drive-thru line. The Taco Bell was hovering in the sky, surrounded by stars. \"That's so cool!\" said Matt Damon. He looked around him, amazing by what he was seeing. The skies were filled with aliens, all of them eating tacos and burritos. He placed his order and picked up his food. There he stood among the stars, with his burrito and his nachos, a very happy man. \"I'm really glad I'm not afraid of flying now,\" he said. Then he realized, he didn't know how to get back to the spaceship. He ate his meal as his panic increased. But in the end, he did not know the way back. And that is how Matt Damon became the regional manager of Taco Bell Intergalactic Inc. \n",
