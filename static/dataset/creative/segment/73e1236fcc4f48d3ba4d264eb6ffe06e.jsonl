You cannot believe it. The queen bee tells you that it is true and that she has come to help you. She says she is at your aid and she will dispense any member of her hive to aid you too. \"But how did I get picked for this role?\" you ask, incredulously.

You just can't understand how you were tapped for this role but then Michael explains. \"Do you remember the time you had that peanut butter and honey sandwich?\" he asks. \"Well, the Almighty King of the Bees was watching and saw you happily enjoying your sandwich. He knows you like honey and was moved by your love of it. So he decided that you would be a perfect human leader of the bees.\" You are surprised that eating such a simple thing as a peanut butter and honey sandwich would land you such a title and role in the world, but it doesn't seem like you can argue more. You have been chosen. Michael says to you \"Remember, we are here to serve you.\" You nod and then send the bees on their first task. You tell the bees to go far away and to not come back. The bees are obligated to listen to your commands and do so. \n",

Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\" You're shocked to hear the little voice speak to you and even more shocked to find that it belongs to a bee. The bee introduces himself as Michael and tells you not to be afraid of him. \"But I'm deathly allergic,\" you tell Michael. Michael laughs and tells you that he has a surprise for you. Suddenly a swarm of bees surround you and the queen bee arrives. She lands on your shoulder and says \"Honey, what are your orders?\" The rest of the swarm begins to buzz. The queen tells you that they're yours to command. You protest to Michael again that you are deathly allergic to this swarm of bees and you cannot be near them. Michael tells you that they will not hurt you. \"No one is going to sting you,\" he promises. \"You will be absolutely fine with us.\" You're still hesitant. But Michael tells you that the Almighty King of the Bees has sought you out as the next human leader of all bees, and that thus no one would dare sting you. \"But I'm not a bee,\" you respond. \"Yes, but you are the human leader of all bees,\" Michael responds. You cannot believe it. The queen bee tells you that it is true and that she has come to help you. She says she is at your aid and she will dispense any member of her hive to aid you too. \"But how did I get picked for this role?\" you ask, incredulously. The queen explains that the Almighty King of the Bees has been watching you for a while, and he sees your potential to be a great leader.
