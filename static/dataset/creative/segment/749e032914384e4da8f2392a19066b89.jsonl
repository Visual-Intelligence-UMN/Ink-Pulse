It reads \"I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job.\" Signed simply, \"JFK.\"\n\nObama pans around the room and looks nervously. He begins to check around the room for any more clues to what is happening. After a minute of searching, he finds a note in his suitcase that reads \"There is no need to look any further. Obama packs up his stuff and exits the room to the courtyard. He informs his wife is simply going out for a walk. Obama goes to the corner store and dials the number on the letter. Two men with black suits come up in a black car and tell Obama to get in. Obama jumps in the back and is driven to an abandoned warehouse. When he shows up miraculously JFK is sitting in a chair in the middle of the warehouse. Obama gasps and cannot believe what he sees. \"Sorry about the theatrics Obama, but I don't like to be followed.\" \n\nJFK beings to tell Obama about the secret society. He tells him that he was not the only president who was a part of the society, but since his retirement, Obama is now being asked to join. Obama is delighted as he is always willing to do anything he can to help his country. JFK tells Obama that the society was started by his father and after the death of JFK, it fell on him to carry on the work. They begin to talk about the mission of the society, which is to make sure the country remains prosperous for all time to come. JFK goes on to tell Obama that the society is governed by a group of twelve men (all former presidents), he is one of them. JFK explains Obama will have to fake his death so no one suspects anything and he will need to sever all ties with family and friends. \n\nObama agrees and they start to talk about upcoming missions. Deep in the back of Obama's head he is scared but excited that he will be able to help the country further as that is what he puts first above all. JFK tells Obama that the first mission will be in four days time.\n",
