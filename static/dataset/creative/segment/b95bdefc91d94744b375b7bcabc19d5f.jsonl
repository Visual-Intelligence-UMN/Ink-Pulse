You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\"\n\nTaken aback you shake your head only to hear the same tiny voice say \"Your Majesty? Your orders please?\" You look to the bee on your shoulder and say \"What are you talking about? Are you even talking to me? Can a bee talk?!\" your voice rises as you grow confused and upset.\n\nThe polite bee responds \"Of course I'm talking to you, Your Majesty. We've finally found a way to communicate with you, and I'm here to help you rule the kingdom.\" \n\n\"But, but, but...\" you stutter \"I must be going crazy, how can a bee talk to me? Why am I asking a bee that? Why am I speaking out loud with no one around?\" And then you realize what you just said. There is no one around you other than a bee. To many, this may not seem like much. But people are ALWAYS around you! You've never been alone, and now you're alone with a talking bee. \n\n\"What have you done to my guards?!!\" you shout to the bee\n\n\"Your guards!? They were holding you prisoner, your majesty!\" the bee says in a shocked tone.\n\n\"Prisoner? This is my home, with my mother and her security!\" you reply\n\n\"Your mother!? YOUR MOTHER!\" The bee shouts in a slightly louder tone followed by an irritated buzz. \"She's been holding you here for years! She's been keeping you here, keeping you from your people.\"\n\n\"My people? Who are my people?\" you ask, confused.\n",

Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\"\n\nTaken aback you shake your head only to hear the same tiny voice say \"Your Majesty? Your orders please?\" You look to the bee on your shoulder and say \"What are you talking about? Are you even talking to me? Can a bee talk?!\" your voice rises as you grow confused and upset.\n\nThe polite bee responds \"Of course I'm talking to you, Your Majesty. We've finally found a way to communicate with you, and I'm here to help you rule the kingdom.\" \n\n\"But, but, but...\" you stutter \"I must be going crazy, how can a bee talk to me? Why am I asking a bee that? Why am I speaking out loud with no one around?\" And then you realize what you just said. There is no one around you other than a bee. To many, this may not seem like much. But people are ALWAYS around you! You've never been alone, and now you're alone with a talking bee. \n\n\"What have you done to my guards?!!\" you shout to the bee\n\n\"Your guards!? They were holding you prisoner, your majesty!\" the bee says in a shocked tone.\n\n\"Prisoner? This is my home, with my mother and her security!\" you reply\n\n\"Your mother!? YOUR MOTHER!\" The bee shouts in a slightly louder tone followed by an irritated buzz. \"She's been holding you here for years! She's been keeping you here, keeping you from your people.\"\n\n\"My people? Who are my people?\" you ask, confused. \n\n\"We are your people, your Majesty. The bees, the butterflies, the winged ones, the pollinators. We are all under your command\" the bee says in a respectful tone.\n\n\"Are the spiders under my command as well?\" you ask\n\"ABSOLUTELY NOT, dirty creatures spiders! Too many legs, not enough wings!\" The bee says in disgust. \n\n\"So, what do you want me to do?\" you ask\n\n\"We want you to come with me, to the hive, to meet the queen. If we leave now, we can travel quickly and safely\"\n\nAt this point you are so confused that you are sure this is either a dream, a hallucination or something much less dire. So rather than continue to argue with what may or may not be a real bee, you simply say \"Yes, lets leave\"\n\nThe bee leads you to a nearby hive, and you follow.
