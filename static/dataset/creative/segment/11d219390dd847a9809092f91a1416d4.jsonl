You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. You can control the movie by making a series of choices. It' like one of those choose your own adventure books you enjoyed so much as a child. The movie begins, and everyone sits quietly waiting to see what will happen, or what you will make happen. The film shows you as a child, growing up. These years speed by fast, because it seems so boring to everyone. The real excitement will come when you get older. What will your career choice be? Will you get married? Will you be rich? The possibilities are endless.\n\nWhen you're about twenty, the movie jumps forward to show your thirties. You can see yourself making the same mistakes over and over again. You are trapped in a vicious cycle, and you can't seem to break out. It is time to make some real changes to improve your life, or it will end up like the number of variants sitting by you in the theater. You hit the option to make a career change to one you love instead of one you are obligated to. Since everyone else in the room seems to be passed out from boredom, your choice becomes the reality of the new you. You love what you are now doing for a living, and for the first time in your life, you feel satisfied with your lot.\n\nThen you decide to play the lottery. Something you hadn't really done before. The winning numbers are called, and they belong to the new you. What a sweet surprise. So much money all at once, you can do anything. A new house, a new car, vacations. You quit your job and begin to spend endless days on vacation and shopping and basically lounging about. But is this life really any better? Shouldn't you be doing more with all the money you have? You tell yourself that it's okay because you have the money now to help people who need it. That's it! Helping those in need. This is something you have always wanted to do in your past lives, but never had the money or time to do it. \n\nSuddenly, you notice movement in the theater.
