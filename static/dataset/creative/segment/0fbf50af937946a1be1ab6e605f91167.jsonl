        "text": "Humans once wielded formidable magical power. But with over 7 billion of us on the planet now, Mana has spread far too thinly to have any effect. When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again.\n\nThe people who started to discover this long lost power of how to use mana were called Magicians. It was up to them to try to stop the hostile aliens from completely annihilating the human race. They had their work cut out for them to say the least. \n\nWhat is mana you ask? Well, it is the life force that flows through everything. Some people call it the soul of the world, ever renewing. None the less, the magicians had a plan to get rid of the aliens for good. They would use the power of mana to summon a giant dragon to destroy the aliens. It was a spell they found in a book that was written thousands of years ago, and yet preserved for this very moment. The old magicians knew this day was coming. They knew that the time of the dragons was coming again, to save all humans from an alien invasion.\n\nAll the magicians of today had to come together in one area to cast the spell. So they did. It worked like a charm, and not just one dragon came from it, but thousands. They flew all around the planet wiping out the aliens on the ground. They didn't really have any trouble with that either, because the aliens did not ever expect it, and did not know how to deal with it. The aliens were used to fighting humans, not dragons. After a short while, all the dragons flew up to space with their powers, and destroyed the alien mother ship. Making sure the aliens would never return. \n\nAfter the dragons had finished their work destroying the aliens, they all returned to their sacred place. They also left word that if the humans needed them again, to just summon them.\n",
