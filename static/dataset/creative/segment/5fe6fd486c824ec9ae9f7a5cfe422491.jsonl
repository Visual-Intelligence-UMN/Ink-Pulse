There's no radio or phone nearby, and you're sitting by yourself in the garden.

A thousand thoughts flash through your mind. \"If one touches your skin, you will die,\" your mother had warned. She had smashed any bee, keeping them away from landing on you. \n\n\"I'm going to die,\" you think. The bee crawls down your arms, to your hand, and then on to the table.

You can't believe your ears. \n\n\"I'm not the queen,\" you say, \"I'm just a girl.\" \n\"You are the queen, my Queen,\" the bee says, \"and I am your loyal servant.\" \"Your mother is dying, and sent me here to help you escape\" \n\n\"My mother is fine,\" you say, \"I just saw her. She was going to the market with a friend.\"  \"That is not your mother, My queen. That is a consort of wasps.\" The bee explains, \"They have taken over your mother's body and mind. Your true mother is in the woods near here, safe, with the rest of the honeybee hive!\" \n\n\"But I can't leave,\" you say, \"I'm allergic to bees.\" \"No\" The bee says. \"You are not allergic to bees.\n",
