As in the dead President John F Kennedy? What the heck is going on? You pick up the phone, and after a long wait you are connected to Lee Harvey Oswald. He wants to meet with you at Jack Ruby's Nightclub in Dallas. \nYou are a bit leery, but you go to the meeting. \n\nLee Harvey Oswald informs you that JFK needs your help. The Zombies are taking over the Presidency and he needs you to stop them. Lee gives you a \"magic stick\" and tells you to give it a wave, and that will summon the Zombie-B-Gone. \n\nYou go back to Washington D.C. and see that all of the statues are being replaced with Zombies! \nYou use the magic stick, and wave it around. The Zombie-B-Gone is activated, and the zombies disappear! \n\nYou've defeated the zombies and saved the Presidency. The zombies are gone, but you have a new job now. You must now save the world from the rise of zombies across the globe. \n\nYou decide to start with a place in the middle of nowhere. You feel the zombies have been hiding in this town, and you must investigate. As you enter the town, it's apparent that something is wrong. There are no humans walking around and all of the cars have been abandoned.\n",
