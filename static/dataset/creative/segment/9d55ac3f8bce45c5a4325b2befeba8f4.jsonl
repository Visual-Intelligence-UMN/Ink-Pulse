It reads \"I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job.\" Signed simply, \"JFK.\" \n\nYou are surprised, but you chuckle to yourself. You think to yourself, \"I'm sure this is just a prank, but I'll play along.\" After all, you think to yourself, JFK wasn't really killed that fateful day in the past, and he was still living today in Nebraska.\n\nLooking at the number, you dial it into your personal phone. You decide against the landline, as it is still likely tapped by US agencies. The phone rings a few times, and then a voice answers.\n\n\"Good, it seems you are taking this seriously Mr. Obama, in a voice that sounds eerily to JFK\".\n\nNot a bad impression you think, although you've heard better. You then reply, \"Okay JFK, what do you need me to do so urgently?\"\n\n\"I need you to come to Nebraska, and meet me at my house, we have urgent matters to discuss. Please come alone.\" Once finished, the line goes dead, and you stand in your house wondering how odd this all really is. You think for a while what awaits you in Nebraska, probably a fan or admirer that wants to see you so badly. Deep inside, you feel an odd sense of fear, as the voice on the phone seemed genuine in their request.\n\nNevertheless , you pack your bags and head to the airport. You could use the break, and perhaps even enjoy yourself in Nebraska. You arrive shortly in Nebraska, and call a cab to the address. It is a quaint house , with a white picket fence, and a nice green lawn. Basically inconspicuous, almost blending in with the rest of the houses nearby. You walk up to the door, and ring the doorbell. You hear footsteps nearing, and watch as the door opens. Standing on the other-side, is the splitting image of JFK, albeit a bit older.\n\n\"Ah, Mr. Obama, it's a pleasure to meet you, I am glad you can make it.\"\n\n\"But your supposed to be dead, shot in the head by Lee Harvey Oswald,\" you bluntly reply to JFK.\n\n\"That's what the public was told and saw that fateful day, but it's a lie. A way to keep me hidden for my current line of work, more important than the presidency. Please come inside, and we can discuss this more privately.\"\n\nOnce inside, JFK leads you to the basement, into a room full of technological marvels and wonders you have never seen before.   \"This is my work room, where I conduct my work for the government.\n",

You walk up to the door, and ring the doorbell. You hear footsteps nearing, and watch as the door opens. Standing on the other-side, is the splitting image of JFK, albeit a bit older.\n\n\"Ah, Mr. Obama, it's a pleasure to meet you, I am glad you can make it.\"\n\n\"But your supposed to be dead, shot in the head by Lee Harvey Oswald,\" you bluntly reply to JFK.\n\n\"That's what the public was told and saw that fateful day, but it's a lie. A way to keep me hidden for my current line of work, more important than the presidency. Please come inside, and we can discuss this more privately.\"\n\nOnce inside, JFK leads you to the basement, into a room full of technological marvels and wonders you have never seen before.   \n\n\"This is my work room, where I conduct my work for the government. It is an important job, I was chosen like you to lead a new force, to combat an enemy like no other.\"\n\n\"What enemy?\" you ask.\n\n\"The ones that walk among us, those that came from the stars,\" replied JFK with a stern face and dropping a folder labeled classified in front of you.\n\nYou open the folder, and see the picture of a man, with a face that looks like a cross between a human and an alien. JFK mentions they are hybrids, imperfect specimens seen in the past, but the ones today blend almost too well in cities around the world. JFK mentions to you how you along with other top minds are assembling a task force to neutralize the threat, without citizens knowing what truly is happening around the world.\n\nYou accept, realizing the gravity of the situation. While in the past you were once president of the United States, in a position of power and prestige revered by many, today you find yourself the leader of the task force to combat the alien threat. You will be the one to lead the world in the fight against the alien threat.\n",

It reads \"I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job.\" Signed simply, \"JFK.\" \n\nYou are surprised, but you chuckle to yourself. You think to yourself, \"I'm sure this is just a prank, but I'll play along.\" After all, you think to yourself, JFK wasn't really killed that fateful day in the past, and he was still living today in Nebraska.\n\nLooking at the number, you dial it into your personal phone. You decide against the landline, as it is still likely tapped by US agencies. The phone rings a few times, and then a voice answers.\n\n\"Good, it seems you are taking this seriously Mr. Obama, in a voice that sounds eerily to JFK\".\n\nNot a bad impression you think, although you've heard better. You then reply, \"Okay JFK, what do you need me to do so urgently?\"\n\n\"I need you to come to Nebraska, and meet me at my house, we have urgent matters to discuss. Please come alone.\" Once finished, the line goes dead, and you stand in your house wondering how odd this all really is. You think for a while what awaits you in Nebraska, probably a fan or admirer that wants to see you so badly. Deep inside, you feel an odd sense of fear, as the voice on the phone seemed genuine in their request.\n\nNevertheless , you pack your bags and head to the airport. You could use the break, and perhaps even enjoy yourself in Nebraska. You arrive shortly in Nebraska, and call a cab to the address.
