        "text": "Following World War III, all the nations of the world agreed to 50 years of strict isolation from one another in order to prevent additional conflicts. 50 years later, the United States comes out of exile, only to learn that no one else went into isolation. The United States is now the only nation on the planet. Everyone else fought so violently and endlessly over the past 50 years that they wiped each other out. The people of the US are in disbelief and sadness that their families and friends all over the world are simply gone.\n\nThe US government decides to send a team of astronauts to the Moon to see if there is any life there. As people spanned the globe searching for other humans, there were documents found that some may have escaped the horror and violence of Earth and made it safely to space. The astronauts are sent to the Moon to find out if this is true.\n\nThe astronauts land on the Moon and find a small colony of people who have been living there for 50 years. These intelligent people could see what was going to happen to the remaining countries after the third world war, and fled to space as soon as they were able to obtain a space craft. They have been living peacefully there for fifty years, and aren't happy to see anyone from Earth searching them out. They are a very peaceful people, and don't want to be bothered by anyone. The moon citizens remember how violent and unethical the people from the US had been in the past, and they want to part of them in their peaceful colony. The astronauts are sent back to Earth with the message that the Moon citizens want to be left alone.\n\nThe US government is disgusted to find out that these people don't want to return to Earth. And further irritated that they don't want to welcome Americans to their homestead. The US government decides that the Moon citizens must be destroyed, and sends a team of astronauts to the Moon to destroy the colony. No one can be allowed to live who disagrees with the commands of the US government. As the other countries were dying out over the past 50 years around the globe, the United States was becoming a dictatorship. The free will of the people was reduced to nothing, and the government told everyone what to do in almost all aspects of their lives.\n\nThe astronauts land on the Moon and find that the Moon citizens are not willing to fight for their lives. They escaped the horror of Earth to get away from violence and it has long not been a part of who they are. Intrigued by this stand and show of peace, the astronauts decide to disobey their government. They simply can't bring themselves to take innocent lives, even at the command on their country. The astronauts return to Earth and tell the US politicians that the moon colony has been destroyed and its citizens annihilated. There is no way for the government to find out if the astronauts speak the truth, so they believe them. \n",
