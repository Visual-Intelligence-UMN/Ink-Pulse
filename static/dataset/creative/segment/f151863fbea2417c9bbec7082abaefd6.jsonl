You have them ask to bring back you specifically. They are told it is possible, but difficult. They say they don't even ethically think they should. You have your new self insist. \n\nThey go back into hypnosis, and you are brought back to life. You take over and replace them. You are eager to see what you have been missing, but the whole process has exhausted you. You go home to rest. You wake up, excited to start your fresh new life. However, you spend this life second guessing yourself. Are your decisions your own or is someone else controlling them? You begin to get paranoid. \n\nYou decide to go to someone who is into black magic. You have them cast a spell that will erase all of your previous reincarnations. You think this will make sure no one else is controlling you. However, the spell backfires. You forgot that you are a reincarnation. The spell works and all of your reincarnations in the room disappear. You also disappear and now no more versions of you will ever exist. \n",
