Mark was appreciative of his new parents, and sympathized with them the struggles they had providing for them. He made sure to focus on his studies, and his parents were more than happy with the grades on his report card. Mark had decided to continue his education and strive for a college degree, something he regretted not getting when he was living as Lance.\n\nIn time he would succeed at getting his degree, which made his parents very proud of him.

He was happy with how life had turned out for him, and his new parents were very proud of what he had accomplished. Mark decided unlike his past life, he would continue to live life to the fullest. He decided then to start a family, unlike Lance did when he lived his life. \n\nHe met a wonderful woman who he eventually married, and they had two children.\n",
