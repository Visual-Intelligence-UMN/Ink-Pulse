After a time, even without Phones, Tv and modern internet, we were able to communicate anyway. \n\nThe aliens had not been expecting this. This was shocking to them. They thought taking our tech would weaken us into submission, forcing us to come to cities to get news or reconnect. Being able to do this without confronting the aliens was the human remnant ace in the hole. They began to organize, amassing materials, and knowledge. We remainders found a way. We figured out that the aliens depended upon SOME things grown. They preferred soybeans actually, grinding up the whole plant and slurping the whole green things down.  When humans got rid of all soybean seeds, burning them, this confounded our masters, the aliens.  They attempted to eat corn, beets, wheat, etc.  This didn't work out well.\n\nThe aliens got violently ill when noshing on anything but soybeans. We wise Mana strong persons, got them out by starving them out.  When they tried to, one at a time, invade a farm, the farmers set fire to the fields, further confounding them. They had no choice, we finally had our land back, then we went to the cities, reorganizing them, once we saw the last ship zip high into the sky. At last they were gone. We could finally do what we wanted, have fun and reorganize our phones and internet, bigger and better than before.\n",
