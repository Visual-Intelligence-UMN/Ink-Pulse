You were in general scared of getting hurt, whether it was from being stung from a bee, or from getting hurt from tripping on the grass. Your parents tried to get you to play outside more with your friends, but struggled to ease your fears. One day, they decided to take you to the park, and let you play with your friends.\n\nAlthough you were happy to see them, you could not ease your fears completely nor calm your nerves. You still tried to play with them, having the occasional fun while playing kick ball with them. As hours pass, your friends and their parents all go home, leaving you with your parents in the park. There were others there, but you did not know them, nor did you want to go near them. Your parents suggest you should play a bit more in the park, before heading on back home. You reluctantly agree, and head back to play in the grass. While playing, you then hear an odd voice that speaks out to you.\n\n\"Hey there, little one,\" the voice calmly states, although you are not sure where it comes from.\n\nYou turn and look around, thinking it was an adult that was speaking to you nearby.\n\n\"I'm right here, little one,\" the voice says, as you see a small, yellow creature with a black face, and wings on its body near your legs. It was a bee, just like the others you were scared of whenever they flew too close to you when playing outside.\n\n\"I'm not going to hurt you, little one,\" the bee says, as it lands on your hand. You ease up a bit, but still feel nervous as it crawls onto your hands.\n\n\"I'm just here to help you,\" the bee says, as it flies up to your face. You start to feel more calm, and realize the bee won't hurt you as you initially feared.\n\n\"I'm here to help you realize your true potential, to help you be more confident when playing outside\" the bee says, as it flies around your head. You wonder how it would be able to do so, asking it out loud how it will do such a thing. \n\n\"I'll help you get over your fears, and help you be more confident when playing outside,\" the bee says, as it lands on\n",
